                     <p>Why there are but three of them, and three women cannot serve and content all the men in the VVorld.</p>

                     <l>Some being solemn, and some pleasant were</l>
                     <l>And when he spake, his person did appear</l>
                     <l>Like to the Sun, when no dark Clouds were neer;</l>
                     <l>Fame of his valour, like a trumpet sound,</l>
                     <l>Through Ears from Heart, unto the Eyes rebound;</l>
                     <l>And then his person, like<hi>Mars</hi> did appear,</l>
                     <l>Yet so, as when fair<hi>Venus</hi> Queen was neer.</l>

                     <l>Great Fortune, I at this time do implore,</l>
                     <l>That thou wilt open every hearing door,</l>
                     <l>Which are the Ears: let not my Wit be lost,</l>
                     <l>For want of bearing, nor my words be crost,</l>
                     <l>Nor yet destructed by a busling noise,</l>
                     <l>Or gazing, or observing some light toyes:</l>
                     <l>But let their Ears be sixt, as if their sight</l>
                     <l>Did view my words, till on their Ears they light.</l>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Noble and Right Honourable,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I shall take my discourse at this time out of Ignorance, which discourse, I shall divide into Five Parts, the Gods, Fates, Nature, the VVorld, and Man; for although Ignorance be obscure, and hard to be discovered, yet it is printed in a general Language, being spread and communicated over all the VVorld. I begin with the First, and prime Creature, Ignorant Man. Man takes himself to be the most knowing Creature, for which he hath placed himself next to the Gods; yet Man is ignorant: for what Man is, or ever was created, that knows what the Gods are, or how many there are? Or what power they have, or where they reside? What Man did ever know the Mansions of Glory, the Bowers of bliss, or the Fields of plea|sure? What Man ever knew whether the Gods were Eternal, or bred out of infinite, or rule, or govern, infinite Eternally?</p>
                     <p>Secondly the Fates. What Man is, or ever was, that knows the Fates? As whether they are Gods or Creatures, or whether the Fates are limited, or decree as they please? Or what Man is, or ever was, that knows the decrees of Fate, the links of Destiny, or the chance of Fortune, or the lots of Chance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="260" n="496"/>Thirdly. What Man is, or ever was, that knows what Nature is, or from whence her power proceeds? As whether from the Gods, or Eterni|ty, or infinite, or from the Fates? Or whether the Gods, or Fates, proceed from her? Or what at first set her to work? Or whether her work is pre|scribed, or limited? Or of what she works on? Or what instruments she worketh with? Or to what end she works for? Or whether she shall de|sist from working, or shall work Eternally? Or whether she worked from all Eternity? Or whether her work had a beginning, or shall have an end|ing? What Man knows the beginning of Motion, or the Fountain of Know|ledge, or the Spring of Life, or Gulph of Death? Or what Life is? Or what Death is? Or whether Life, Motion, and Death, had a beginning, or shall have an ending?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly the World. VVhat Man is, or ever was, that knows how the VVorld was made? Or for what it is made? Or by whom it was made? Or whether it had beginning, or shall have end?</p>
                     <p>The Fift and last is Man. VVhat Man is, or ever was, that knows how he was formed, or of what composition, or what is that he calls a Rational Soul? VVhether it is imbodyed, or not imbodyed? VVhether it is Divine, or Mortal? VVhether it proceeds from the Gods, or was created by Na|ture? VVhether it shall live for ever, or shall have a period? VVhether it shall live in Knowledge, or ly in Ignorance? VVhether it be capable of pain, or pleasure? VVhether it shall have a residing place, or no certain place assigned? Or if it have none, where it shall wander? Or if it have, where that residing place is.</p>
                     <p>As for the Body, who knows the perfect Sense of each Sense, or what mistake, or illusions, each Sense is apt to make, or give, or take? VVhat Man knows how the Body dissolves, or to what it shall dissolve? VVhat Man knows whether there be Sense in Death, or not? VVhat Man knows the motion of the thoughts, or whether the thoughts belong only to the Soul, or only to the Body, or partly to both, or of neither? VVhat Man is there that knows strength of passion? As what Faith may beget? Or what Doubts may dissolve? Or what Hopes may unite? Or what Fears may dis|order? Or what Love can suffer? Or what Hate can act?</p>
                     <p>VVhat Man is there that knows the Circumpherence of Admiration, the ri|gour of Adoration, the hight of Ambition, or the bottom of Covetousness? Or what Man knows the end of Sorrow, or beginning of Joy? And as for the Appetites, what Man knows the length and bredth of desire? As for the Senses, what Man is there, that knows the true Sense of Pleasure, or the ut|termost bounds of Pain? VVho can number the varieties of Tast, Sent, Touch, Sound, and Sight? VVhat Man knows the perfect effects of each Sense? Or what Man is there that knows any thing, truly as it is? Yet cer|tainly there cannot be an Athest; for though men may be so irrelligious, as to be of no Religion; yet their can be none so willfull, and utterly void of all Sense, and Reason, as not to believe there is a God; for though we have not the true light of knowledge, yet we have as it were a perpetual twilight; Man lives as at the poles of knowledge; for though we cannot say it is truly day, yet it is not night. Man may perceive an Infinite power, by the perfect distinctions of all particular varieties, by the orderly production of several Creatures, and by the fit, and proper shapes of every several kind of Creature; by their orderly Births, by the times and Seasons, to produce, flourish, and decay; by the distinct degrees, qualities, properties, places and
<pb facs="260" n="497"/>
motions of all things, and to, and in every thing, by the exact form of this VVorld; by the prudent seperations, and situations of the Heavens and Earth; by the Circumferent lines, and poyzing Centers; by their bounds and limits; by their orderly, and timely motions; by their assigned tracts, constant Journies, convenient distances; by their intermixing, and well tempering of the Elements; by the profitable Commerce, betwixt the Hea|vens and the Earth; by the different kinds, several sorts, various Natures, numerous numbers of Creatures; by their passions, humours, appetites; by their Sympathies, and Antipathies; by their warrs and parties; by the Harmony that is made out of discord, shews that there is onely one absolute power, and wise disposer, that cannot be opposed, having no Copartners, pro|duces all things, being not produced by any thing, wherefore must be Eter|nall, and consequently infinite; this absolute, wise, and Eternal power Man calls God; but this absolute power, being infinite, he must of necessity be incomprehensible, and being incomprehensible, must of necessity be un|known, yet glimses of his power is, or may be seen; yet not so, but that Man is forced to set up Candels of Faith, to light them, or direct them to that they cannot perfectly know, and for want of the clear light of know|ledge, Man calls all Creations of this mighty power Nature; his wise de|crees, Man calls Fates; his pointed will, Man calls Destiny; his several Changes, Man calls Fortune; his Intermixing Man calls Life; his sepera|ting, Man calls Death; the Sympathetical, and Antipathetical motions of the Senses, and their Objects, Humours, and their Subjects, Man calls Plea|sure, and Pain; the interchanging motions in Man, Men call Sense, and Knowledge; the seperating motions, Man calls Ignorance, Stupidity, and Insensibility; my application is, that this absolute Power, wise Disposer, and decreeing Creator, hath created himself Worship, in making Creatures to worship him; and it is probable, Truth decreed Judgment, Punishment, and Bliss, to such of his Creatures as shall omit, or submit thereunto: my exhoration to you is, to bough humbly, to pray constantly, to implore ser|vently, to love truly, to live awfully to the worship of this incomprehensible power; that you may injoy bliss and avoid torment.</p>

                     <p>O no, for a Coward is affraid to use a Sword, and a Valiant man is affraid to be without the use, otherwise a strong sturdy Clown, might cuff him down, and kick him like a Football on the ground, which a Sword, and skill to use it, will prevent; for a Clown hath not skill to defend, or assault a Sword, having no practice therewith, nor ought they to have; for the use of this kind of Arms makes a Clown a Gentleman, and the want of skill makes a Gentleman a Clown; for a Right bred Gentleman, is to know the use of the Sword, and it is more manly to assault, than to defend; also to know how to mannage Horses, whereby we know how to assault our Enemy as well as to defend our selves; for it is not playing with a Fidle, and dancing a Measure, makes a Gentleman; for then Princes should dub Knighthood with a Fidle, and give the stick, and a pair of Pumps, insteed of a Sword, and a pair of Spurs.</p>

                     <p>My Lord, we are so far from wearing our Swords our selves now a dayes, as we give them our Footmen to carry, as if it were a disgrace to carry a Sword our selves.</p>

                     <p>Tis true, and we are well beaten for our follies, for disarm|ing our selves, and arming our Slaves; for now a Groom is made a Gentle|mans equal, nay his Superior sometimes; for if a Groom kills a Gentle|man, the Gentleman dyes in disgrace, and the Groom lives with Honour, and gets the Fame of a gallant Person; for that is the phrase to all those that have fought, although they were forced thereto as Slaves, not distinguishing true valor, which is voluntary, temperate and just.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>Why then there should be a Decree, of Law, that none should wear Swords but Gentlemen, nor Arms allowed, but to those of approved merit.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <p>You say right, unless in time of Forein Wars, and then there should be a difference in their Arms; for if there be no difference of Arms, no difference of persons, and if there be no difference of persons, there will be no Supremacy of Power, if no Supremacy, no Royal Govern|ment; for as the Sword maintains the Prerogative of the Crown, so it doth the Honour of a Gentleman; and as the Sword keeps up the dignity of the Crown, so a Sword keeps up the Heraldry of a Gentleman; and no man ought to be accounted a Gentleman, that knows not how to use his Sword, and manage his Horse; for the one defends himself, and kills his Enemies; the other, doth front and charge his Enemy, and pursues him if need require.</p>

                     <p>For mine? why sure that is not so, for certainly you would not take that pains, and bestow so much cost, for one you do enjoy allready, for a Husband that is tied to you for life, and cannot quit on Ho|nourable terms; wherefore it is for one is loose and free, which you do strive by setting forth your self with garments rich, for to attract, and draw to your desires.</p>

                     <p>But Virtue is best acceptable, when Beauty doth present it; and Beauty finds most favour, when well attired; but were I sure you would like me better in mean Garments, and careless dresses, I then should Cloath my self in Freez, &amp; like a Hermit my loose course Garments ty with single cord about my waste; but I will go and pull these Cloaths off, since they are thought a crime, and I thought false for wearing them.</p>

                     <p>I will discourse at this time of Love, not of the superfluous Branches, or wither'd leaves, or rotten fruits, but of the Root of Love, which is Self-love; It is the Root and Original Love in Nature; it is the Foundation of Nature, it is the Fountain from whence issues all the several Springs; Self-love was the cause of the Worlds Creation; for the Gods out of love to them|selves, caused Creatures to be Created, to worship them: thus all Crea|tures being created out of self-love, and their chief being proceeding out of self-love, is the cause that every particular Creature loves themselves in the first place, and what Love is placed on any other, or to any other, from any particular, is derived from self-love; for we love the Gods but out of self-love, as believing the Gods love us; we adore the Gods but out of self-love, because we think we proceed from them, or were produced by their commands; we pray to the Gods but out of self-love, because we hope the Gods will help us in distress; we bless the Gods but out of self-love, be|cause we do verrily believe the Gods will exalt, and Crown us with everlast|ing glory; and to shew that we Love the Gods, not as they are Gods, but for our own sakes, as believing they will or can do us good, is, that we are apt to murmure at the Gods, when we have not our own desires; we are apt to accuse the Gods, when any wordly thing crosses us; we are apt to curse the Gods at ill Accidents, Misfortunes, or Natural losses; we are apt to forget the Gods in the midst of pleasure; we are apt to think our selves Gods in the pride of prosperity; we strive to make our selves Gods in the hight of worldly power; and we do not only strive to make our selves equal with the Gods, but to raise our selves above the Gods, taking, or command|ing to our selves more worship than we give unto the Gods; nay, those that are accounted the most holy and devout Servants of the Gods, belie the Gods, taking the name of the Gods to cover their own follies; as for exam|ple, whensoever any eminent person hath had ill success, either in, or after their Foolish, Ambitious, and Vain-glorious actions, they charge the Gods Decrees and pleasure, as it was the Gods will it should be so; like as she that Vaingloriously had her two and only Sons to draw her Chariot, like two Horses, or Dogs, or Slaves, and being both found Dead the next day, she had prayed to the Gods to reward them with that which was best for them, and being both dead, she said the Gods accounted Death as the best reward, when they no doubt dyed with over heating themselves, striving beyond
<pb facs="263" n="503"/>
their natural power and strength; yet these two Sonns that drew the vain Mo|ther in a Chariot, drew and died out of self-love; either like as vain Sonns like their vain Mother, vaingloriously to get a fame, or believing the Gods would reward them for their Act, either with extraordinary prosperity, pow|er, or blessedness in the Life to come; and many the like examples may be gi|ven; for how ordinary is it in these our times, and in former times, for the politicks to perswade the people, with promises from the Gods, or to tell them it is the Gods commands they should do such and such acts, even such acts as are unnatural, wicked, and most horrid? thus Men bely the Gods to abuse their fellow Creatures. But most Noble and Right Honourable, my explanation of this discourse is, that since Self-love is the Fountain of and in Nature from whence issue out several Springs to every several Creature, wherein Mankind being her chiefest and Supreme work, is filled with the fullest Springs from that Fountain, which is the cause that Mankind is more industrious, cruel, and unsatiable, to and for his self ends, than any other Creature, he spares nothing that he hath power to destroy, if he fears any hurt, or hopes for any gain, or finds any pleasure, or can make any sport, or to imploy his idle time; he melts metalls, distills and dissolves plants, dis|sects animals, substracts and extracts Elements, he digs up the bowels of the Earth, cuts through the Ocean of the Sea, gathers the winds into Sails, fresh waters into Mills, and imprisons the thinner Ayre; he Hunts, he Fowls, he Fishes for sport, with Gunns, Nets, and Hooks; he cruelly causeth one Creature to destroy another, the whilst he looks on with delight; he kills not only for to live, but lives for to kill, and takes pleasure in torturing the life of other Creatures, in prolonging their pains, and lengthning their Deaths; and when Man makes friendship of Love, it is for his own sake, ei|ther in humouring his passion, or feeding his humour, or to strengthen his party, or for Trust, or Counsel, or Company, or the like causes; if he dies for his friend, it is either for fame, or that he cannot live himself happy with|out his friend, his passion, and grief, making him restless; if Man loves his Children, Wife, or Parents, tis for his own sake; he loves his Parents, for the honour he receives by them, or for the life he received of them; if he loves his Wife, or the Wife the Husband, it is for their own sakes, as their own pleasure, as either for their Beauties, Wits, Humours, or other Graces, or for their Company, or Friendships, or because they think they love them; if they love their Children, it is for their own sakes, as to keep alive their memory, and to have their duty, and obedience, to bow and do homage to them; If Masters love their Servants, it is for their own sakes, because they are trusty, faithfull and industrious in their affairs, imploy|ments, or for their own profit, or ease; and if Servants love their Masters, it is for their own sakes, as either for their power to protect them, or for the regard they have to them, or for the gain they get from them, or for their lives that are nourished, and maintained by them; if Amorous Lovers love, it is for their own sakes, as to please the Appetite, and to satisfy their desires; if Subjects love their Soveraigns, it is for their own sakes, as that they may have Law and Justice, Peace and Unity; If Sovereigns love their Subjects, it is for their own sakes, because they bear up his Throne with their Wealth and Industry, and fight to maintain, or get him power. My Appli|cation, most Noble and Right Honourable, is, that since we do all, and in e|very act for our own sakes, we should indeavour, and study, for that which is best for our selves, and the ground of our indeavour is to learn, and know
<pb facs="264" n="504"/>
our selves, every particular person must learn and know himself, not by comparative, as observing others, for every man is not alike; but by self study, reading our own Natures and Dispositions, marking our own Passions, mours, and Appetites, with the Pen of Thought, and Ink of Examination; and let the Truth be the Tutor to instruct you in the School of Reason, in which you may Commence Master of Art, and go out Doctor of Judgment, to practise Temperance; for Temperance keeps in its full strength, prolongs Beauty, quickens Wit, ripens Youth, refreshes Age, restores Decayes, keeps Health, maintains Life, and hinders Times ruines; but Temperance is not only a Doctor of Physick; a Physician to the Body, but a Doctor of Divinity, a Divine for the Soul; It preaches and teaches good Life, it instructs with the Doctrine of Tranquillity, and guides to the Heaven of Happiness; also Temperance is the Doctor of Musick, it tunes the Senses, composes the Thoughts, it notes the Passions, it measures the Appetites, and playes a Har|monious Mind. Thus Most Noble and Right Honourable, I have proved that Self-love is the Fountain of Nature, and the Original Springs of her Creatures, and that Temperance is the strongest Foundation of Self-love, although few build thereupon, but upon Intemperance, which is a hugh Bulk of Excess, the substance of Riot, worm eaten with Surfers, rotten with Pain, and sinks down to death with Sickness and Grief, not being able to bear and uphold Life; wherefore build your Lives upon Temperance, which is a strong and sure Foundation, which will never fail; but will uphold your Lives as long as Time and Nature permits them, and your Souls will dwell peaceably, and happily therein.</p>

                     <l>Great Fame my Prayers I direct to thee,</l>
                     <l>That thou wilt keep me in thy memory;</l>
                     <l>And place my Name in the large brazen Tower,</l>
                     <l>That neither Spight, nor Time may it devour;</l>
                     <l>And write it plain, that every age may see,</l>
                     <l>My Names inscrib'd to live eternally:</l>
                     <l>Let not Malice obstruct my Wit with spight,</l>

                        <hi>Noble and Right Honourable,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I divide my discourse into three parts, as namely Vanity, Vice, and Wickedness; Vanity lives in the Customs and Manners of men, and Wick|edness in the Souls of men, Vices in the Senses of men, as vain habits, evill appetites, and wicked passions; as for Vanity and Vice, they are commo|dities that are sold out of the Shops of Idleness; Vice is sold by wholesale, but Vanities are sold by retail; the Buyers of these Commodities are Youth, the Merchants, are evil Customs, and ill examples; the Masculine youth buyes more Vice than Vanity, and the Effeminate youth buyes more Va|nity than Vice; but they all buy, as salt as they can be sold; they will spare for not cost, and will give any prices, although it be their Healths, Lives, Fortunes, or Reputations; as for Wickedness, it is inlayed into the soul like as Mosaick work, and so close it is wrought therein, as it makes it ap|pear to be the soul it self; but evill Education and Custome, are the Artifi|cers of this work, and not natural Creation, or divine infusion, or inspira|tion, from whence the Soul proceeds, or is produced, for neither the Gods, nor Nature, is the Author of Wickedness; but Vanity, Vice, and Wick|edness, are soon catcht, and like the Plague, they infect all they come near, and Vanity, Vice, and Wickedness is soon learn'd, when Virtue, Goodness, and Piety, are hard Lessons; for though Divines and natural Philosophers, Preaches, and so teaches them, yet they are seldom understood; for if they were, the benefit would be known, and men would pious and virtuous be, for profits sake; for Common-wealths that are composed, and governed by Virtue, Religion, and good Life, they are so strongly united by honest love, as they become inpregnable against Forein Foes, or home factions, or
<pb facs="267" n="510"/>
temptations, so live in peace and plenty, which breeds both pleasure and delight; for life doth never truly injoy it self, but in rest, ease, and peace; but to conclude most Noble and Right Honourable, the Soul, Se●se, and Education, should be plain with Truth, smooth with Virtue, and bright with Picty, or Zeal; that the Body may live Easily, the life Peaceably, and that the Soul may be blessed with Everlasting Glory.</p>

                     <p>I will tell you, when I was new Married, my Hus|band took so much notice of my Dress, that the least alteration he observed; nay he grew jealous at it, and thought each curl a snare set to catch Lovers in; after I had been Married some little space of time, he condemned me for carelessness, and desired me to various dresses; and now drest, or undrest, he never observes; for were I drest with splendrous light, as glorious as the Sun, or Clouded like dark Night, it were all one to him; neither would strike his Sense; yet I observe he doth observe my Maids, as that one hath a fine Pettycoat, and another hath handsome made Shooes, and then he pulls up their Pettycoats a little way, to see what stockings they have, and so views them all over, and commends them, saying, they are very fine, when all these Garments he commends on them, were mine, which I had cast off, and given to them; when those Garments though fresh and new, when I did wear them, he ne|ver took notice of; besides, when my Maids do come into the Room where he and I are, he strives to talk his best, as if he wisht, and did indea|vour

their good opinion, when only alone with me the rubbish of his dis|course doth serve the turn.</p>

                     <p>Lord how idly you speak Cousin, as to think men might idly pass away their time, when Nature allows life no idle time; for all things are growing, or decaying, feeding life, or getting food for to nourish life, or bearing, or breeding for increase; and man which only by his shape exceeds all other Creatures in Reason, Knowledge, and Under|standing, and will you have him cast away these supreme gifts of Nature with idle time? would you have men follow the Sense only, like a Beast, and not to be guided by reason to some noble study, or profitable action? would you have them yield to their surfeting Appetites, and not indeavour to temper them? is Sickness less painfull than Health? is Disorder to be pre|fer'd before Method, or Inconveniency before Conveniency, Warrs before Peace, Famine before Plenty, Vice before Virtue? all which would be if idle time wery allow'd; for Idleness never found out Arts nor Sciences, or rules of Government, nor the ease of Temperance, nor the profit of Prudence, nor the commands of Fortitude, nor the peace of Justice, which Industry produceth; but Idleness brings Confusion.</p>

                     <p>I shall take my discourse at this time out of Beauty, the ground of which discourse is Eyes; Eyes are the Beauty of Beauty; for if the Eyes be not good, the face though ne'r so fair, or otherwise well featur'd, cannot be pleasing; the truth is, Eyes are the most Curious, Ingenious, Delightfull; and Profita|ble work in Nature; Curious in the Aspect and Splendor; Ingenious in the form and fashion, Delightfull in the Society, and Profitable in their Com|merce, Trade, and Traffick, that they have with all the rest of Natures works: for had not Nature made Eyes, all her works had been lost, as be|ing buryed in everlasting darkness; for it is not only Light that shews her works, but Eyes that see her works: wherefore if Nature had not made Eyes she had lost the glory of Admiration and Adoration, which all her Animal Creatures give her, begot, raised, or proceeding from what they see; besides, not only Light the presenter of objects would have been lost, but Life would have been but only a dull Melancholy Motion for want of sight, and for want of sight life would have wanted knowledge, and so would have been ignorant both of its self and Nature; but now life takes delight by the fight, through the Eyes, and is inamor'd with the Beauties it
<pb facs="271" n="519"/>
views; and the Eyes do not only delight themselves and life with what they receive, but with what they send forth; for Eyes are not only passages to let Light, Coulours, Forms, and Figures in, but to let Passions, Affections, Opini|ons out; besides, the Eyes are not only as Navigable Seas, for the Animal Spirits to Traffick on, and Ports to Anchor in; but they are the Gardens of the Soul, wherein the Soul sits and refreshes it self, and Love the Sun of the Soul, sends forth more glorious Rayes than that Sun in the Sky, and on those objects they do shine, they both comfort and give a nourishing delight; but yet when the light of love doth reflect, the heat doth increase by double lines, and quickness of motion, which causes many times a Distemper of the Thoughts, which turns to a Feavor in the Mind; but to conclude most Noble and Right Honourable, Eyes are the Starrs which appear only in the Animal Globe, to direct the life in its Voyage, not only to places that life knows, but to new discoveryes; and these Animal Starrs do not only guide the Animal life, but have an influence and various effects on the Soul, and are not only to view the Beauties of all the other works of Nature, but are the chiefest Beauties themselves; and if that Reason that is the Educator of the Life, and chief Ruler and Commander of the Soul, did not cross and hinder the influence of these Animal Starrs, they would prove very fatal to many a one: Wherefore Right Honourable, my Application is, that you obey Reason, and pray unto it as to a Deity, that it may divert the Malig|nant influences, and cause them to point to a Happy Effect.</p>

                     <p>Yes, if it had been to maintain her Beauty against rude Despi|sers, or her Virtue against base Detractors, or her Honour against wicked Violators; for her Soul hath as many beautifull graces and Virtues, and her mind as many noble qualities, as her body hath beautifull Parts, Lineaments, gracefull Motions, pleasing Countenances, lovely Behaviour, and courteous Demeanors.</p>

                     <p>So, I thought she had some relation to you, that you spake so much in her praise; this Self-love bribes all our Tongues; but Brother, you have so fired my Spirits, as I am almost as mad as the Gentleman I fought with, before I see her, meerly with the report, and since I must lose my Wits with the rest of Mankind, for I find all are mad that come within the list of her Name, pray let me part with my Wits on Honourable terms, as at the view of her Beauty.</p>

                     <p>Heaven forbid Wife you should become a Thorn in my Mind, but thou art there as my Soul, nor do I love you at a common rate: for were thy person more deformed than ever Nature made, either by Sickness or Casualty, I still should love thee for thy Virtuous Soul; and though your person is very handsom, yet I consider not your Beauty but your Health, so you be well, I care not how you look; for my love is at that height as it is beyond the body grown; for should I only love you for your Beauty, when that is decayed, my love must of necessity dy, if Beauty were the life.</p>

                     <p>To quarrel and fight for me is strange, for as for the one I never saw, and the other I have no acquaintance with; but had I favoured the one, or affronted the other, or had favoured them both, it might have raised a dispute, from a dispute to a quarrel, from a quarrel to a duell; but many times men make a seeming love the occasi|on to shew their courage, to get a fame; but what fame soever men get, the woman loses, as being thought either too kind, or cruell.</p>

                     <p>Sister, this Gentleman never saw you, only fought in his own defence; he desires you would give him leave to come and kiss your hands, he is a very gallant man, and an experienced Souldier.</p>

                     <p>A Souldier? why he never lead an Army, nor pitcht a Field, nor fought a Battel; he never Intrencht, nor Incampt; he never guarded, kept, nor took Fort, Town, or City; perchance he hath studied as most Gentlemen do, so much of Fortification, as to talk of Trenches, Lines, Ramparts, Bullworks, Curtains, Wings, Faces, Forts, Centries; And of Amunition, Cannon, Muskets, Carabines, Pistols, Slings, Bowes, Arrows, Darts, Pikes, Bills, Halbards, Bolts, Poleaxes, Swords, Ci|meters, Shot, Bullets, Powder, Drums, Trumpets, Waggons, Tents and the like; and for Arms, Pot, Back, Breast, Gantlets, Corselers, Gorgets and the like, thus they learn the Names, but seldome practice the use.</p>

                     </speaker>

                     <p>The truth of it is, that my Landlady as old as she is, loves the Company of men, especially of young men; for if a young man will trou|ble himself to stay in her Company, and talk to her, she is so pleased, as she makes more wrinckles with her smiles, than Time hath made, and she will simperingly put in her Chin, as if she were but fifteen.</p>

                     <p>From the root of Self-love grows many several Branches; as Divine, Love, Moral Love, Natural and Sympathetical Love, Neighbourly and Ma|trimonial Love; Divine Love is the Love to the Gods, Moral Love is the
<pb facs="274" n="525"/>
Love to Virtue, Natural Love is the Love to Parents and Children, Sympa|thetical Love is of Lovers, or Friendships, Neighbourly Love is the Love of Acquaintance, and true Matrimonial Love is the Love of United Souls, and Bodyes; but I shall only insist or discourse at this time for my Sisters sakes, of Matrimonial Love; this Matrimonial Love, is the first imbodyed Love that Nature created; for as for Divine Love, and Moral Love, they are as incorporeal as the Soul, and Sympathetical and Matrimonial Love, which I will joyn as Soul and Body, were before Natural, or Neighbourly Love, for Marriage beget, Acquaintance, and none lives so neer nor converses so much as man and wife; and there was a Sympathy and Conjunction of each Sex, before there were Children, and there could be no Parents before there were Children; thus Matrimonial Love was the first substantial Love, and being the Original and producing Love, ought to be honoured and preferr'd as the most perfect and greatest Love in Nature; but mistake me not Noble and Right Honourable, when I say the greatest Love in Nature, I mean not the Supernatural Love, as Divine Love as to the Gods; but this Matrimonial Love, I say is to be the most respected, as the Original Love, like as Nature is to be honoured and preferred before the Creatures she makes; so Matri|monial Love ought to be respected first, as being the cause of Friendly, So|ciable, Neighbourly, and Fatherly Love; wherefore man and wife ought to forsake all the world, in respect of each other, and to prefer no other delight before each others good or content; for the Love of Parents and Children, or any other Love proceeding from Nature, ought to be waved when as they come in Competition with the Love man and wife; for though Matri|monial Love is not such a Divine Love as from man to the Gods, yet it is as the Love of Soul and Body, also it is as a Divine Society, as being a Union; but Right Honourable, to tell you, my opinion is, that I belive very few are truly married; for it is not altogether the Ceremony of the Church nor State that makes a true marriage; but a Union and indissoluble Conjunction of Souls and Bodyes of each Sex; wherefore all those that are allowed of as man and wife, by the Church, State, and Laws, yet they are but Adul|terers, unless their Souls, Bodyes, and Affections, are united as one; for its not the joyning of hands, speaking such words by Authentical persons, nor making of vows, and having Witnesses thereof, that makes a true marriage, no more than an Absolution without a Contrition, makes a holy man: wherefore dear Sisters, and you two Heroick Worthies, marry as you ought to do, or else live single lives, otherwise your Children will be of a Bastard kind, and your associating but as Beasts, which are worse than Birds, for they orderly chuse their Mates, and lovingly fly and live together, and equally labour to build their nest, to feed their young, and Sympathetically live, and love each other, which order and love few married persons ob|serve, nor practice; but after all this, even those marriages that are the per|fectest, purest, lovingest, and most equallest, and Sympathetically joyned, yet at the best marriage is but the womb of trouble, which cannot be avoided, also marriage is the grave or tomb of Wit; for which I am resolved for my part to live a single life, associating my self with my own Thoughts, marrying my self to my own Contemplations, which I hope to conceive and bring forth a Child of Fame, that may live to posterity, and to keep a-live my Memory; not that I condemn those that marry, for I do worship married persons, as accounting them Saints, as being Martyrs for the good cause of the Common-wealth, Sacrificing their own Happiness and Tranquillity,
<pb facs="275" n="526"/>
for the weal publick; for there is none that marries that doth not increase their Cares and Pains; but marriage Unites into Familyes, Familyes into Villages, Villages into Cities, Cities into Corporations, Corporations into Common-wealths; this increase keeps up the race of Mankind, and causes Commerce, Trade, and Traffick, all which associates men into an Agree|ment, and by an Agreement men are bound to Laws, by Laws they are bound to Punishments, by Punishments to Magistrates, and by Magistrates and Punishments to Obedience, by Obedience to Peace and Defence, in which Center of Peace my dear Sisters, I wish you may live, and be guarded with the Circumference of Defence, that nothing may disturb or indanger you or yours; and that you may live in true marriage,and increase with united love, blest with Virtuous Children, and inrich'd with prudent Care, and Industry: also I wish and pray that Jealousy may be banished from your Thoughts, Pains and Sickness from your Bodyes, Poverty from your Fami|lyes, evill Servants from your Imployments, Disobedience from your Children.</p>

               <l>Because my Love was spotless, pure, and Chast,</l>
