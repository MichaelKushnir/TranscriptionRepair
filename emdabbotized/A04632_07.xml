                  <p>_MY hope is not so nourish'd by ex|ample, as it will conclude, this dumbe peece should please you, by cause it hath pleas'd others be|fore: but by trust, that when you haue read it, you will find it wor|thy to haue dis-pleas'd none. This makes, that I now number you, not onely in the Names of fauour, but the Names of iustice, to what I write; and doe, presently, call you to the exercise of that noblest, and manlyest vertue: as coueting rather to be freed in my fame, by the authority of a Iudge, then the credit of an Vndertaker. Read therefore, I pray you, and censure. There is not a line, or syllable in it changed from the simplicity of the first Copy. And, when you shall consider, through the certaine hatred of some, how much a mans innocency may bee indanger'd by an vn-certaine accusation; you will, I doubt not, so beginne to hate the iniquitie of such natures, as I shall loue the contumely done me, whose end was so honora|ble, as to be wip'd off by your sentence.</p>

                  <l>_TRuth sayes, of old, the art of making plaies</l>
                  <l>Was to content the people; &amp; their praise</l>
                  <l>Was to the <hi>Poet</hi> money, wine, and bayes.</l>
                  <l>But in this age, a sect of writers are,</l>
                  <l>That, onely, for particular likings care,</l>
                  <l>And will taste nothing that is populare.</l>
                  <l>With such we mingle neither braines, nor brests;</l>
                  <l>Our wishes, like to those (make publique feasts)</l>
                  <l>Are not to please the cookes tastes, but the guests.</l>
                  <l>Yet, if those cunning palates hether come,</l>
                  <l>They shall find guests entreaty, and good roome;</l>
                  <l>And though all relish not, sure, there will be some,</l>
                  <l>That, when they leaue their seates, shall make 'hem say,</l>
                  <l>Who wrot that piece, could so haue wroten a play:</l>
                  <l>But that, he knew, this was the better way.</l>
                  <l>For, to present all custard, or all tart,</l>
                  <l>And haue no other meats, to beare a part,</l>
                  <l>Or to want bread, and salt, were but course art.</l>
                  <l>The <hi>Poet</hi> prayes you then, with better thought</l>
                  <l>To sit; and, when his cares are all in brought,</l>
                  <l>Though there be none far fet, there will deare-bought</l>
                  <l>Be sit for ladies: some for lords, knights, squires,</l>
                  <l>Some for your waiting wench, and citie-wires,</l>

                  <l>Here, that his feast will last; but you shall eate</l>
                  <l>A weeke at ord'naries, on his broken meat:</l>

                        <p>S'lid, I would be the author of more, to vexe him, that pur|pose, deserues it: it giues thee law of plaguing him. I'll tell thee what I would doe. I would make a false almanack; get it printed: and then ha' him drawne out on a coronation day to the <hi>tower</hi>-wharfe, and kill him with the noise of the ordinance. Dis-inherit thee! hee cannot, man. Art not thou next of bloud, and his sisters sonne?</p>

                        <p>Yes faith. The fellow trims him silently, and has not the knacke with his sheeres, or his fingers: and that continence in a bar|ber hee thinkes so eminent a vertue, as it has made him chiefe of his counsell.</p>

This is not, onely, fit modestie in a seruant, but good state, and discretion in a master. And you haue beene with CVTBERD, the barber, to haue him come to me? (—) good.

                        <p>Alas, sir, I am but a messenger: I but tell you, what you must heare. It seemes, your friends are carefull after your soules health, sir, and would haue you know the danger (but you may doe your pleasure, for all them, I perswade not, sir) If, after you are married, your wife doe run away with a vaulter, or the <hi>Frenchman</hi> that walkes vpon ropes, or him that daunces the iig, or a sencer for his skill at his weapon, why it is not their fault; they haue discharged their consciences: when you know
<pb n="541" facs="292"/>
what may happen. Nay, suffer valiantly, sir, for I must tell you, all the perills that you are obnoxious too. If shee be faire, yong, and vegetous, no sweet meats euer drew more flies; all the yellow doublets, and great roses i' the towne will bee there. If foule, and crooked, shee'll bee with them, and buy those doublets and roses, sir. If rich, and that you marry her dowry, not her; shee'll raigne in your house, as imperious as a widow. If noble, all her kindred will be your tyrannes. If fruitfull, as proud as <hi>May,</hi> and humorous as <hi>April</hi>; she must haue her doctors, her midwiues, her nurses, her longings euery houre: though it be for the dearest morsell of man. If learned, there was neuer such a parrat; all your patrimony will be too little for the guests, that must be inuited, to heare her speake <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Greeke</hi>: and you must lie with her in those languages too, if you will please her. If precise, you must feast all the silenc'd brethren, once in three daies; salute the sisters; entertaine the whole family, or wood of 'hem; and heare long-winded exercises, singings, and catechisings, which you are not giuen to, and yet must giue for: to please the zealous ma|tron your wife, who, for the holy cause, will cosen you, ouer and aboue. You beginne to sweat, sir? but this is not halfe, i'faith: you may do your pleasure notwithstanding, as I said before, I come not to perswade you. Vpon my faith,<note place="marg" anchored="true">

One thing more (which I had almost forgot.)

The like has beene heard of, in nature. 'Tis no deuis'd impossible thing, sir. God b'w' you: I'll be bold to leaue this rope with you, sir, for a remem|brance. Farewell MVTE.</p>

                        <p>My masters, doe not put on this strange face to pay my courte|sie: off with this visor. Haue good turnes done you, and thanke 'hem this way?</p>

                        <p>Fore heau'n, you haue vndone me. That, which I haue plotted for, and beene maturing now these foure moneths, you haue blasted in a minute: now I am lost, I may speake. This gentlewoman was lodg'd here by me o'purpose, and, to be put vpon my vncle, hath profest this obstinate silence for my sake, being my entire friend; and one, that for the requitall of such a fortune, as to marry him, would haue made mee very ample conditions: where now, all my hopes are vtterly miscaried by this vnlucky accident.</p>

                        <p>The best, the happiest that euer was, sir. There has beene a mad gentleman with your vncle, this morning (I thinke this be the gen|tleman) that has almost talk'd him out of his wits, with threatning him from marriage—</p>

                        <p>And your vnkle, sir, hee thinkes 'twas done by your procure|ment; therefore he will see the party, you wot of, presently: and if he like her, he sayes, and that she be so inclining to dombe, as I haue told him, he sweares hee will marry her, to day, instantly, and not deferre it a minute longer.</p>

As I conceiue, CVTBERD, this gentlewoman is shee, you haue prouided, and brought, in hope shee will sit me in the place and person of a wife? Answer me not, but with your leg, vnlesse it be otherwise: (—) very well done CVTBERD. I conceiue, besides, CVTBERD, you haue beene pre-acquainted with her birth, educa|tion, and quallities, or else you would not preferre her to my acceptance, in the waighty consequence of marriage.

                        <p>Admirable creature! I will trouble you no more: I will not sinne against so sweet a simplicity. Let me now be bold to print on those diuine lips, the seale of being mine. CVTBERD, I giue thee the lease of thy house free: thanke me not, but with thy leg (—) I know what thou woulst say, shee's poore, and her friends deceased; shee has brought a wealthy dowr●e in her silence, CVTBERD: and in respect of her pouerty, CVTBERD, I shall haue her more louing, and obedient, CVTBERD. Goe thy waies, and get me a minister presently, with a soft-low voice to marry vs, and pray him he will not be impertinent, but briefe as he can; away: softly, CVTBERD. Sirrah, conduct your mistris into the dining roome, your now—mistris. O my felicity! how I shall bee reueng'd on mine inso|lent kinsman, and his plots, to fright me from marrying! This night I will get an heire, and thrust him out of my bloud like a stranger; he would be knighted, forsooth, and thought by that meanes to raigne ouer me, his title must doe it: no kinsman, I will now make you bring mee the tenth lords, and the sixteenth ladies letter, kinsman; and it shall doe you no good kinsman. Your knighthood it selfe shall come on it's knees, and it shall be reiected; it shall bee sued for it's fees to execution, and not bee re|deem'd; it shall cheat at the tweluepeny ordinary, it knighthood, for it's diet all the terme time, and tell tales for it in the vacation, to the hostesse: or it knighthood shall doe worse; take sanctuary in <hi>Coleharbor,</hi> and fast. It shall fright all it friends, with borrowing letters; and when one of the foure-score hath brought it knighthood ten shillings, it knighthood shall go to the Cranes, or the Beare at the <hi>Bridge</hi>-foot, and be drunk in feare: it shal not haue money to discharge one tauerne reckoning, to inuite the old creditors, to forbeare it knighthood; or the new, that should be, to trust it knighthood. It shall be the tenth name in the bond, to take vp the com|moditie of pipkins, and stone jugs; and the part thereof shall not furnish it knighthood forth, for the attempting of a bakers widdow, a browne bakers widdow. It shall giue it knighthoods name, for a <hi>stallion,</hi> to all gamesome citizens wiues, and bee refus'd; when the master of a dancing schoole, or (<hi>How</hi> do you call him) the worst reueller in the towne is taken: it shall want clothes, and by reason of that, wit, to foole to lawyers. It shall not haue hope to repaire it selfe by <hi>Constantinople, Ireland,</hi> or <hi>Virgi|nia</hi>; but the best, and last fortune to it knighthood shall be, to make DOL TEARE-SHEET, or KATE COMMON, a lady: and so, it knighthood may eate.</p>

                        <p>So I iudg'd by the phisiognomy of the fellow, that came in; and I had a dreame last night too of the new pageant, and my lady Maio|resse, which is alwaies very ominous to me. I told it my lady HAVGHTY t'other day; when her honour came hether to see some <hi>China</hi> stuffes: and shee expounded it, out of ARTEMIDORVS, and I haue found it since ve|ry true. It has done me many affronts.</p>

                        <p>Yes, sir, anything I doe but dreame o'the city. It staynd me a damasque table-cloth, cost me eighteen pound at one time; and burnt me
<pb n="555" facs="299"/>
a blacke satten gowne, as I stood by the fire, at my ladie CENTAVRES chamber in the colledge, another time. A third time, at the Lords masque, it dropt all my wire, and my ruffe with waxe-candle, that I could not goe vp to the banquet. A fourth time, as I was taking coach to goe to <hi>Ware,</hi> to meet a friend, it dash'd me a new sute all ouer (a crimson sattin doublet, and blacke veluet skirts) with a brewers horse, that I was faine to goe in and shift mee, and kept my chamber a leash of daies for the anguish of it.</p>

Could your grauitie forget so olde and noted a remnant, as <hi>lippis &amp; tonsoribus notum.</hi> Well sir, forgiue it your selfe now, the fault, and be communicable with your friends. Here will bee three or foure fashionable ladies, from the colledge to visit you presently, and their traine of minions, and followers.</p>

                        <p>Beleeue it, I told you right. Women ought to repaire the losses, time and yeeres haue made i' their features, with dressings. And an intel|ligent woman, if shee know by her selfe the least defect, will bee most cu|rious, to hide it: and it becomes her. If shee be short, let her sit much, lest when shee stands, shee be thought to sit. If shee haue an ill foot, let her weare her gowne the longer, and her shoo the thinner. If a fat hand, and scald nailes, let her carue the lesse, and act in gloues. If a sowre breath, let

her neuer discourse fasting: and alwaies talke at her distance. If shee haue black and rugged teeth, let her offer the lesse at laughter, especially if shee laugh wide, and open.</p>

                        <p>It is to them an acceptable violence, and has oft-times the place of the greatest courtesie.

                        <p>'Tis true. No more then all birds, or all fishes. If you appeare learned to an ignorant wench, or iocund to a sad, or witty to a foolish, why shee presently begins to mistrust her selfe. You must approch them i' their owne height, their owne line: for the contrary makes many that feare to

commit themselues to noble and worthy fellowes, run into the imbraces of a rascall. If shee loue wit, giue verses, though you borrow 'hem of a friend, or buy 'hem, to haue good. If valour, talke of your sword, and be frequent in the mention of quarrels, though you be staunch in fighting. If actiuitie, be seene o' your <hi>barbary</hi> often, or leaping ouer stooles, for the credit of your back. If shee loue good clothes or dressing, haue your lear|ned counsell about you euery morning, your <hi>french</hi> taylor, barber, lin|nener, &amp;c. Let your poulder, your glasse, and your combe, be your dearest acquaintance. Take more care for the ornament of your head, then the safetie: and wish the common-wealth rather troubled, then a haire about you. That will take her. Then if shee be couetous and crauing, doe you promise any thing, and performe sparingly: so shall you keepe her in ap|petite still. Seeme as you would giue, but be like a barren field that yeelds little, or vnlucky dice, to foolish, and hoping gamesters. Let your gifts be slight, and daintie, rather then pretious. Let cunning be aboue cost. Giue cherries at time of yeere, or apricots; and say they were sent you out o' the countrey, though you bought 'hem in <hi>Cheap-side.</hi> Admire her tyres; like her in all fashions; compare her in euery habit to some deitie; inuent excellent dreames to slatter her, and riddles; or, if shee bee a great one, performe alwaies the second parts to her: like what shee likes, praise whom she praises, and faile not to make the houshold and seruants yours, yea the whole family, and salute 'hem by their names: ('tis but light cost if you can purchase 'hem so) and make her physitian your pensioner, and her chiefe woman. Nor will it bee out of your gaine to make loue to her too, so shee follow, no vsher, her ladies pleasure. All blabbing is taken a|way, when shee comes to be a part of the crime.</p>

There was neuer fencer chal|leng'd at so many seuerall foiles. You would thinke hee meant to mur|der all Saint PVLCHRES parish. If hee could but victuall himselfe for halfe a yeere, in his breeches, hee is sufficiently arm'd to ouer-runne a countrie.</p>

                        <p>Not I, neuer in my life, broke iest vpon any man. The bride was praising sir DAVPHINE, and he went away in snuffe, and I followed him, vnlesse he tooke offence at me, in his drinke ere while, that I would not pledge all the horse full.</p>

                        <p>By my faith, and that may bee, you remember well: but hee walkes the round vp and downe, through euery roome o' the house, with a towell in his hand, crying, where's LA-FOOLE? who saw LA-FOOLE? and when DAVPHINE, and I, demanded the cause, wee can force no an|swere from him, but (Ô reuenge, how sweet art thou! I will strangle him in this towell) which leads vs to coniecture, that the maine cause of his furie is for bringing your meate to day, with a towell about you, to his discredit.</p>

Clap but a ciuill gowne with a welt, o' the one; and a canonical cloake with sleeues, o' the other: and giue 'hem a few termes i' their mouthes, if there come not forth as able a Doctor, and compleat a Parson, for this turne, as may be wish'd, trust not my election. And, I hope, without wronging the dignitie of either profession, since they are but persons put on, and for mirths sake, to torment him. The Barber smatters <hi>latin,</hi> I remember.</p>

If you chance to be out, doe not confesse it with standing still, or humming, or gaping one at another: but goe on, and talke alowd, and eagerly, vse vehe|ment action, and onely remember your termes, and you are safe. Let the matter goe where it will: you haue many will doe so. But at first, bee very solemne, and graue like your garments, though you loose your selues after, and skip out like a brace of iugglers on a table. Here hee comes! set your faces, and looke superciliously, while I present you.</p>

                        <p>Nay, good gentlemen, doe not throw me into circumstances. Let your comforts arriue quickly at me, those that are. Be swift in affoor|ding me my peace, if so I shall hope any. I loue not your disputations, or your court-tumults. And that it be not strange to you, I will tell you. My father, in my education, was wont to aduise mee, that I should alwayes collect, and contayne my mind, not suffring it to ●low loosely; that I should looke to what things were necessary to the carriage of my life, and what not: embracing the one and eschewing the other. In short, that I should endeare my selfe to rest, and auoid turmoile: which now is growne to be another nature to me. So that I come not to your publike pleadings, or your places of noise; not that I neglect those things, that make for the dignitie of the common-wealth: but for the meere auoiding of clamors, &amp; impertinencies of Orators, that know not how to be silent. And for the cause of noise, am I now a sutor to you. You doe not know in what a mi|serie I haue beene exercis'd this day, what a torrent of euill! My very house turnes round with the tumult! I dwell in a wind-mill! The perpe|tuall motion is here, and not at <hi>Eltham.</hi>

                        <p>Your question is, for how many causes a man may haue <hi>diuor|tium legitimum,</hi> a lawfull diuorce. First, you must vnderstand the nature of the word diuorce, <hi>à diuertendo</hi>—</p>

                        <p>I answere then, the Canon-law affords diuorce but in few cases, and the principall is in the common case, the adulterous case. But there are <hi>duodecim impedimenta,</hi> twelue impediments (as we call 'hem) all which doe not <hi>dirimere contractum,</hi> but <hi>irritum reddere matrimonium,</hi> as wee say in the Canon-law, <hi>not take away the bond, but cause a nullitie therein.</hi>

                        <p>Well, DAVPHINE, you haue lurch'd your friends of the better halfe of the garland, by concealing this part of the plot! but much good doe it thee, thou deseru'st it, lad. And CLERIMONT, for thy vnexpected bringing in these two to confession, weare my part of it freely. Nay, sir DAW, and sir LA-FOOLE, you see the gentlewoman that has done you the fauours! we are all thankefull to you, and so should the woman-kind here, specially for lying on her, though not with her! You meant so, I am sure? But, that we haue stuck it vpon you to day, in your own imagin'd persons, and so lately; this <hi>Amazon,</hi> the champion of the sexe, should beate you now thriftily, for the common slanders, which ladies receiue from such cuckowes, as you are. You are they, that when no merit or fortune can make you hope to enioy their bodies, will yet lie with their reputations, and make their fame suffer. Away you common moths of these, and all ladies honors. Goe, trauaile to make legs and faces, and come home with some new matter to be laught at: you deserue to liue in an aire as corrup|ted, as that wherewith you feed rumor. Madames, you are mute, vpon this new <hi>metamorphosis</hi>! but here stands shee, that has vindicated your fames. Take heed of such <hi>insectae</hi> hereafter. And let it not trouble you that you haue discouer'd any mysteries to this yong gentleman. He is (a'most) of yeeres, &amp; will make a good visitant within this twelue-month. In the meane time, wee'll all vndertake for his secrecie, that can speake so well of his silence. Spectators, if you like this <hi>comoedie,</hi> rise cheerefully, and now MOROSE is gone in, clap your hands. It may be, that noyse will cure him, at least please him.</p>
