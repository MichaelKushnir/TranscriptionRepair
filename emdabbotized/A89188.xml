                     <p>It is truth Nurſe; I have ever rejected her Counſels (though I have alwayes made the World believe I have followed them moſt preciſely) and though I ſent for her in my extremitie, and deſired her to indite that ſeigned Confeſſion ſo to blinde the eyes of the World that I might the more ſecurely and undiſco|vered compaſſe mine own Deſigne, yet know Nurſe, that I hate her companie, and loath her ſight, much leſſe will I follow her Dictates and Directions.</p>

                     <p>No, do not Miſtris, Did you ever reap any benefit by her companie? or, Did at any time any good accrew to you by following her counſell? If the People ſhould know all that ſhe can tell of you (and ſhe can as well be hanged [which you know is the leaſt you have deſerved] as conceal her knowledge, but will at ſome time or other diſcover all) What would be the event thereof? Indeed Miſtris I tremble to thinke (being in the ſame condemnation, and deſerving the ſame reward with your ſelfe) and by that little experience thereof, which you have had of late you may be ſenſible enough what you muſt expect.</p>
                     <p>No, no, Miſtris, if you hope to recover again, make uſe of Miſtris <hi>Mendax,</hi> the whole Packe of your weekly forging Pam|phleters, they have ever ſtucke cloſe to you, and by imploying them ſtill, you know how advantagious it hath been to the ad|vance of your Deſignes; but among them all there is none (ſince <hi>Britannicus</hi> his deceaſe) comparable to <hi>Luke Haruney</hi> or <hi>Walker,</hi> the <hi>quondam</hi> pillorie Iremonger, he is alwaies at your elbow, with his out-ſide <hi>Satin,</hi> and in-ſide <hi>Devil,</hi> ready to breathe into the eares of your tame Guls and nooſed Woodcockes, what you thinke may beſt advantage the <hi>Cauſe</hi> (though never ſo falſe) in his perfect Occurrence.</p>
                     <p>Beſides it is evident what ſervice his double diligence hath done you in endeavouring to ſuppreſſe your worſt Enemies, the Tell-truths of the Times, <hi>Pragmaticus, Melancholicus, Elenti|chus, &amp;c.</hi> whoſe publiſhing the Truth of thoſe foul Enormities which they by intelligence have and do daily diſcover in your Actions, have done you more hurt of late, than all the Kings Ar|my could heretofore; by their pennes having wounded you deep|er in your credit and reputation, than ever the Sword of the Ca|valiers did your bodie in your Souldiers; and therefore the care of your creature <hi>Walker,</hi> in endeavouring to diſcover and ſo ſup|preſſe them, deſerves your notice and encouragement.
