The scholemaster doth briefly instruct them their duetie tovvardes God, their Prince, their Parents, their cuntrie, and all magistrates in the same. The eldest be|ing yong men of quicke capacitie, do (Parrotte like) ve|ry quickly learne the rules vvithout booke: the yonger beeing somevvhat more dull of vnderstanding, do yet engraue the same vvithin their memories. The elder by allurement of Parasites and levvde company, beginne to incline themselues to concupiscence. The parents (to preuent it) sende them all togither to the Vniuersitie of <hi>Dowaye,</hi> vvhereas the yonger in short space be (by paine|full studie) preferred, that one to be Secretarie vnto the <hi>Palsegraue,</hi> that other becommeth a famous preacher in <hi>Geneua.</hi> The eldest (turning to their vomit) take their cari|age vvith them, and trauaile the vvorlde. That one is apprehended and executed for a robbery (euen in sight of his brother) in the <hi>Palsgraues</hi> courte: that othervvhip|ped and banished <hi>Geneua</hi> for fornication: notvvithstan|ding the earnest sute of his brother for his pardon.</p>

                  <p>I am of your opi●n <hi>Phylocalus,</hi> and since we haue ech of vs two Sonnes of equall age and stature, I would we could be so happie as to finde some honest and carefull schoolemaister, who might enstruct them togither: I say honest, because in the house of the vertuous there is seldome any vice permitted, and carefull, because the care of the teacher is of no lesse consideration then his skill: thē do I wish him both honest and carefull, because the con|iunction of two such qua●ities, may both cause the accom|plishment of his dutie, &amp; the contentations of our desires. Our eldest Sonnes are neare the age of xxi. yeares, &amp; our younger Sonnes not much more then one yeare be|hinde them. So that as they haue hitherto bene thought toward enough at such common schooles as they haue fre|quented, and therefore wil shortly be ready for the vniuer|sity, yet would I thinke conuenient that they spent some time together, with some such honest and careful Schoole|maister, who might before theyr departure lay a sure foū|dation to their vnderstanding.</p>

                  <p>Surely it séemeth you haue not hytherto lost your time, and the order of your enstruction hath bene such, that you might presently be able to take further pro|céedinges in an Uniuersiry, so that it should be (vnto me) but labour lost to stand still vpon those pointes, since it see|meth that you haue bin therein perfectly grounded: neuer|thelesse wée will continue the exercise of the same, and wée will therevnto ioyne such holesome preceptes, as may be|come a rule and Squire, wherby the rest of your lyfe and actions may be guyded. For alchough <hi>Tully</hi> in his booke of dewtyes doth teach sundry vertuouse preceptes, and out of <hi>Terence</hi> may also be gathered many morall enstructi|ons amongst the rest of his wanton discourses, yet the true christian must direct his steppes by the infallible rule of Gods woord, from whence as from the hedde spring, he is to drawe the whole course of his lyfe. I would not haue you thinke hereby that I do holde in contempt the bookes which you haue redde heretofore but wée will (by Gods grace) take in assistance suc●nt so many of them as may seeme consonant to the holy scriptures, and so ioyning the one with the other, we shalbe the better able to bring our worke vnto perfectiō.

                  <p>Now let vs in the holy name of God be|gin, and he for his mercy geue me grace to vtter, and you to disgest such holesome lessons as may be for the saluatiō of your soules, the comfort of your lyfe, and the prositte of your Countrey.</p>
                  <p>You shall well vnderstand my well beloued schollers, that as God is the author of all goodnesse, so is it requisite that in all traditions and Morall preceptes we begin firste to consider of him, to regard his maiestie, and search the so|ueraigne poyntes of his Godhead. The Heathen Philoso|phers (although they had not the light to vnderstand per|fect trueth) were yet all of them astonyed at the incompre|hensible maiesty and power of God, some of them thought the ayre to be God, some other the earth, some the infinite|nesse of things, some one thing, some another, whose opi|nions I shall passe ouer as thinges vnméete to be much thought of, but by the way, the opinion of <hi>Plato</hi> is not vn|worthy here to bee recited vnto you, who taught plainely that god was omnipotent, by whom the world was made, and al thinges therein created and brought vnto such per|fection as they be in. <hi>Xenophon</hi> affirmed that the true God was inuisible, and that therefore we ought not enquire what or what maner of thing God is. <hi>Aristo</hi> the Stoicke, affirmed lykewyse that God was incomprehensible. To conclude, <hi>Simonides</hi> being demaunded what God was, re|quired one dayes respect to answer, and then being again demaunded the same question, he required two dayes re|spet, at the third apointment of his answere, he came &amp; re|quired thrée dayes, and being demaunded wherefore he did so breake his apointments, and require alwayes further time, he aunswered, that the more déepely that he did con|sider the matter, the more infinite he found it, and there|fore remained alwaies astonyed what to answere, and al|ways craued further time. Truly to leaue y^● heathen opi|nion●<pb facs="11"/>
and to come vnto the very touchestone I thinke it not amisse if we content our selues to thinke that God is omni●otent, and yet his power vnsearchable, and his good|nes vnspeakable. And to be briefe, I wil deliuer vnto you the summe of your dutyes in foure Chapters, the first cha|piter shalbe of God and his ministers, the second of the King and his Officers, the third shall conteyne the duties that you owe vnto your Countrey and the Elders thereof, and lastly you shalbe put in remembraunce of your dutyes towardes your Parentes, and what you ought to be of your selues. In these soure chapters I trust (by Gods help) to enclud● as much as shalbe necessary for the perfect go|uernment of a true Christian.</p>

                  <p>Sir wée beseech you that for as much as this order of teaching is both very compendious, &amp; also much different from the lectures which haue bene redde vnto vs, you will therefore vouchsafe to stand somwhat the more vppon euery point, to the end, that aswell your meaning may be perspicuous, as also that we may the better beare away the same, and not onely learne it without the booke, but also engraue it in our mindes.</p>

                  <p>Your request is reasonable, and it shalbe by mée as readyly graunted, as it hath bene by you necessa|rily required. Your first chapter and lesson shall then be, that in all your actions you haue an especiall eye and re|gard to almighty God, and in that consideration I com|mend vnto your memory, first God himselfe, and seconda|rily his ministers. As touching your duties vnto God him self, although they be infinite, yet shall we sufficiently con|teine them in thrée especiall poynts to be perfourmed: that is to say, <hi>Feare, Loue,</hi> &amp; <hi>Trust.</hi> And first to begin with feare, it shalbe necessary and aboue all thinges your bounden duty, to ●eare God and his omnipoten power. <hi>Linus</hi> that auncient Poet wryteth, that with God all thinges are ea|sie to be accomplished, and nothing is vnpossible. <hi>Tully</hi> in
<pb facs="11"/>
his Oration <hi>Pro Roscio amerino</hi> saith, that the commodityes which wée vse, the light which we enioy, and the breath which we haue and drawe, are giuen and bestowed vppon vs by God: then if with God all thinges be possible (accor|ding to <hi>Linus</hi>) he is to be feared, sithens the least part of his displeasure being prouoked, the greatest part of his will is to him right easie to accomplish: and if we haue our light, our lyfe, and all commodities of his gift (as <hi>Cicero</hi> affir|meth) then is hée to be feared, least with the facillity of his omnipotency he take away as fast as he gaue, or turne light into darknes, life into death, and cōmodities into dis|cōmodities. I might recite you many heathen authorities, but it is most néedlesse, since y^● very word of God himself, is most plaine in this behalfe, and yet I haue here set downe these fewe, because they are not repugnant to holy Scrip|tures. Wée finde written in the xx. chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> that God is a Ielous God, and doth visit the sinnes of the Fa|thers vppon the children vnto the third and fourth genera|tion. <hi>Feare him then for he is most mightie.</hi> Againe: who shall defend me (saith the Psalmist) vntill thine anger be past? <hi>Feare God</hi> then, since against his power no defence preuay|leth. Agai●, both the heauens and the earth obay the voice of his mouth. <hi>Feare him then for althinges are subiect vnto his mighty power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet with this feare you must also ioyne loue, for it is not with God as it is with Princes of the worlde, which to make themselues feared do become Tyrantes, but the<note place="marg" anchored="true">Loue God.</note> goodnes of almighty God is such, that he desireth no lesse to be loued, then he deserueth to be feared, and though his might and power be vniuersall, and there withall his Ie|lousie great, and his displeasure soon prouoked, yet deligh|teth he not in the distruction of mankind, but rather that a sinner should turne from his wickednes and liue. <hi>Tully</hi> in his second booke <hi>de legibus</hi> saith, that God being Lord of al things doth deserue best of mākind, bicause he b●holdeth
<pb facs="12"/>
what euery man is, and with what deuotion he worship|peth the Gods, and kéepeth an accompt aswell of the good as the badde: whereby appeareth that the heathen confes|sed yet t●at the Gods were to be loued, bycause they cared for mankind, and truly that opinion is neither cōtrary to Gods word, nor dissonant to naturall reason. For wée sée by common experience that we loue them best of whom we are most fauoured, &amp; haue receiued greatest benefits. I meane hereby those that rule their doinges by reason, for other●se wée sée dayly wicked men, which (forgetting their duty) do least loue wher they haue most cause. When I my s●lfe was a scholler in the Uniuersity, I remember that I did often tymes defend in Schooles this proposition. <hi>Ingratitudo (tam versus. 'Deos immortales quam apud homines) peccatum maximum.</hi> Ingratitude is the greatest faulte that may be either towards god or man. Let vs cōsider the good ●ies of almighty God, who first created vs to his owne I|mage and similitude, indued vs with reason and know|ledge, preserued vs from innumerable perilles, and proui|ded thinges necessary for our sustentation, and to consider more inwardly the exceeding loue which he bare towardes mankinde, he spared not his onely begotten Sonne, but gaue him (●uen vnto the death of the crosse) for our redem|ption. Oh what minde were able to conceaue▪ or what to●gue able to vtter the loue and goodnes of almighty God towardes mankinde? And since his loue towardes vs, hath bene and yet doth continue infinite, our loue should also be infinite, to r●nder him thanks for his goodnes. But though the causes be infinite which might bind vs to loue GOD, yet is there no cause gr●ater then the manifolde mercyes which he hath she 〈◊〉 wayes to mankind. In the first age when iniquity kindled his wrath to destroy the whole world, he yet vouchsafed to preserue <hi>Noe</hi> and his family, <hi>Loue him then</hi> since he preserueth the good, though it be but for his mercyes sake▪ When the people of <hi>Israell</hi> prouoked
<pb facs="12"/>
him at sundry times, he did yet at euery submission stay his hand from punishment, <hi>Loue God then</hi> since he is ready to forgiue, and though he pronounceth his Ielousie in the twentith of <hi>Exodus</hi> saying, that he visiteth the sinns of the Fathers vppon the children, vnto the third and fourth ge|neration, yet ther withal he addeth, that he sheweth mercy vnto thousandes in them that loue him and kéepe his com|maundementes. <hi>Loue him then</hi> since his mercy is ouer all his works. To conclude, when his vnsearchable Maiestie by his diuine foresight did perceyue, that by the very sen|tence of the Lawe we stoode all in state of condemnation, he sent down his owne and only Sonne, to be slaundered, buffeted, and cruci●d for our sinnes, to the ende that all which beléeue in him, should not perish but haue lfie euer|lasting. <hi>Loue God then</hi> since <hi>mercy</hi> is aboundant with him, and he shall redéeme <hi>Israell</hi> from all his iniquities.</p>
                  <p>And héere vnto this feare and loue you must ioyne a sure<note place="marg" anchored="true">Trust in God.</note> trust and confidence. The promises of mortall men are of|ten times vncertaine, and d● fayle, but the promises of the Almighty are vnfallible. <hi>For the wordes of his mouth returne not voyd and without effect. Tully</hi> in his offices doth vse great arte in declaration what sortes of promises are to be ob|serued, and which may be broken. But the diuine proui|dence and foresight doth promise nothing but that which<note place="marg" anchored="true">Gen. 17</note> he will most assuredly performe. When he promised vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> that <hi>S●ra</hi> his wyfe should beare him a childe, <hi>Sara</hi> laughed bycause she was then foure score &amp; ten yeres o●e, but the almighty remembred his couenant. <hi>Trust in him then</hi> for his woords shall neuer fayle. When he promi|sed <hi>Moyses</hi> to conduct his people through the desertes, they began to doubt and murmure, saying: would God that we<note place="marg" anchored="true">Num. 14.</note> had dyed in the land of <hi>Aegypt</hi> or in this wildernesse &amp;c. and the lord was angry, but yet remembring his promise, at the humble petition of <hi>Moyses</hi> he perfourmed it. <hi>Trust in God therefore,</hi> since no displeasure can make him alter
<pb facs="13"/>
his determination, he perfourmed his holy promyse in <hi>Is|maell,</hi>
                     <note place="marg" anchored="true">Gen. 31.</note> although we read not that he praied vnto God there|fore. I would not haue you think hereby that I condemne or contemne prayer, since it is the very meane to talke with God, but I meane thereby to proue, that God is most iust and faithfull in all his promises, and by repeticion I say, <hi>Feare God for he is mighty, loue God for he is mercifull, and trust in God for he is faithfull &amp; iust.</hi> Herewith all you must also learne to performe duty towardes the seruaunts and<note place="marg" anchored="true">Ministers</note> ministers of God. For as you shall onely be saued by hym, and by cleauing to him in all your actions, so yet are hys ministers the meane &amp; instruments of your saluation, and d● (as it were) leade you by the hand through the waues of this world vn to ●ernall ●elicity, vnto whom you shall owe ●hree seueral duties, that is to say, <hi>Audience, Reuerence,</hi> and <hi>Loue.</hi> The Children of <hi>Israell</hi> by harkening to <hi>Moyses,</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> were not only enstructed and taught their du|tyes, but were (as it were) made at one with God when they had at any time purchased his heauy displeasure. By<note place="marg" anchored="true">Actes. 8.</note> harkning vnto <hi>Phyllip</hi> the Apostle, the <hi>Enuch</hi> was conuer|ted. By harkning vnto <hi>Peter, Cornelius</hi> y^● captain was con|firmed &amp; strengthned in the faith. By harkning vnto <hi>Paule</hi> and <hi>Sylas, Lidia,</hi> and the gaylour of <hi>Phylippos</hi> were baptised,<note place="marg" anchored="true">Actes. 16.</note> the holy scriptures are full of examples to proue this pro|position. <hi>Harken you therfore vnto the ministers of God,</hi> for<note place="marg" anchored="true">Harken to Gods Minist●rs</note> they are sent to enstruct you, so shall it also become you to do thē reuerence in al places, re mēbring that as he which sent them is in all thinges to be honoured, so are they to be had in reuerence for their office sake. Such was the zeale of <hi>Co●elius</hi> the Captaine, that he fell downe prostrate at<note place="marg" anchored="true">Actes. 10.</note>
                     <hi>Peters</hi> féete when he entered into his house, the which though <hi>Peter</hi> refused saying that he was also mortall, yet did it signifie vnto vs, that the ministers of God cannot bée too much reuerenced. The Priestes in the olde Testament were exempt from tributes and impositions, they were
<pb facs="13"/>
not constrained to go into the battaile, they were prouided for sustenance and all thinges conuenient, and the people<note place="marg" anchored="true">Reuerēce gods mi|nisters.</note> were commaunded to do them reuerence. <hi>Do you likewise reuerence vnto Gods ministers</hi> in al places, for it shal become you well. So shall you also loue them bycause they preach the gospel of him which hath power to saue you. If the sen|sual apetite of man be such as engēdreth affection towards thehandmaide bicause she is of familiar cōuersation w^t the Mistris: or bréedeth loue towards them which are in office with Princes, bycause they may also procure vs fauour: how much more ought the mindes of men to be kindled with loue towardes the ministers of God, which enstructs vs diligently, minister vnto vs painfully, and pray for vs faithfully? yea how much are we boūd to loue them, which<note place="marg" anchored="true">Loue the ministers</note> by their hol some preceptes do make vs worthy (through Gods mercy) of his holy loue and fauour. To conclude this chapter, you shall feare God <hi>for his might, loue him for his mercyes, and trust in him for he is faithfull. You shall also harken vnto his ministers bycause they are sent of God, you shall do them reuerence because it becometh you, and for their office sake, and you shal loue them by cause they feede you with the breade of lyfe.</hi> And this I thinke sufficient for explanation of this first chapter at this time.</p>

                  <p>Well then to return vnto the matter, you shall performe vnto the King thrée especial dutyes, that is to say: <hi>Honour, Obediencae,</hi> and <hi>Loue. Hypodamus</hi> in his booke of a common welth, saith that a kingdome is a thing com|pared to the imitation of gods power. <hi>Diotogenes</hi> the schol|ler of <hi>Pytagoras</hi> in his booke of gouernment, saith that a king representeth the figure of God amongst men. Lyke|wise he sayth, that as god excelleth the most perfect things of nature, so the king excelleth amongst men and worldly matters: so that he is to bee honored as the lieutenant of God here vpon earth, both because he hath power of com|maundement, and chiefly because he representeth that hea|uenly King, who is king of kinges, and aboue all Kynges to be honoured: Euen so is hee also to bee obayed in all se|culer constitutions and pollitike prouisions. This obedi|ence doth consequently follow hono●re, as the shadow so|lowes
<pb facs="17"/>
the body, for whatsoeuer he be that gyueth vnto his king that honor which to him apperteineth, will (no doubt) lykewise obay him with all humilitie. <hi>Erasmus</hi> teacheth in his <hi>Apothegmes,</hi> that obediēce expelleth al seditiō &amp; mayn|teyneth concorde: the which may also appeare by naturall reason and common experience, neyther shall they euer become able to beare rule them selues, whiche cannot bee content to obay the aucthoritie of others. Wherfore it shal be most conuenient that you obay the King, synce his auc|thoritie is frō god, &amp; as this obedience dependeth vpon the honour wherewith ye shall reuerence the King as Gods lieutenant, so must you also ioyne therunto an vnfayned loue, for as almightye God is to be loued because hee is mercifull: so the King beeing apoynted by God muste be loued bycause he is thy pretector heere on earth. <hi>Salamon</hi> sayth, that the kings indignation is the messenger of death, whereby I would frame myne argument from the con|trarye, that hee is to be loued, least his indignation being iustly kindled, thou bee not able to beare it. Next vnto the king we are to consider the Magistrates which are ap|poynted for administration of iustice, and pollityke gouer|ment: these Magistrates must also bee honoured, obeyed, &amp; loued: honored because they are y^● substituts of y^● king vnto whom all honour (on earth) apperteyneth, obeyed because theyr office is appointed by the Kings aucthoritie, and lo|ued because they are the graue and expert personages, which deuise lawes and constitutions for continuaunce of peace and tranquillitie. The apostle <hi>Paule</hi> in his xiii. chap|ter of his Epistle to the <hi>Romaines,</hi> teacheth playnely, that Rulers beare not the sworde in vaine, saying: <hi>Let euerie soule be subiect vnto the higher powers, for there is no power but of God. Againe, the ruler (sayth he) doth not beare the sworde in vayne.</hi> Wherefore you must néedes be subiect, not onelye for feare, but also for conscience▪ And Sanct <hi>Peter</hi> in hys fyrst Epistle and the seconde chapiter, doth sufficientli●<pb facs="17"/>
teach vs this point, saying▪ <hi>Submit your selfe vnto all manner ordinaunce of man for the Lordes sake, whether it bee vnto the king as hauing the preheminence, or vnto the rulers as vnto them that are sent of him for the punishment of euill dooers, but for the laude of them that do well.</hi> Whereby appeareth, that the magistrates are not onely to be feared, because they pu|nysh offenders, but also to be loued because they cherish the verteous: and for conclusion of this poynt, if you desire to be good men, then learne to performe duety towardes all magistrates. As <hi>Sophocles,</hi> well sayde, <hi>it becommeth a good man to haue due respect vnto all magistrates.</hi> I might nowe take your Parentes in hande, for the next pointe of your enstruction but I will first touch the duety which you owe vnto your countrye, and that is conteyned also in three especial pointes: that is to saye, in <hi>Thankefulnesse, Defence,</hi> and <hi>Proffit.</hi> And as ingratitude is the most heinous offence against God, so haue I taught you that it is the greatest faulte in humayne actions, amongst the which it sheweth it selfe no way more vntollerable, then if you shoulde hap|pen to bee vnthankefull vnto your country. <hi>Tully</hi> in his offices sayth, that wee are not borne onely for our owne perticuler cause or profit, but parte (sayth he) our cuntrey challengeth, parte our Parentes think due vnto them, and our friendes ought lykewise to enioye some parte of our trauailes. There are dyuers Philosophers, whiche mayn|teyne in argument that all cuntryes are frée for a noble mynde, and I agrée thereunto, but yet thereby they con|clude not, that a noble minde by chusing a new cuntrey to enhabit, maye lawfully forgett the cuntrey wherein hee was natiue. <hi>Zopirus</hi> is condempned in all histories, for the vnthankefulnes he vsed in betraying his cuntrey. The truth of the Troyan historie accuseth <hi>Aeneas, Antenor,</hi> &amp; certeyne others, as most vnthankefull traytors to theyr cuntrey. <hi>Cillicon</hi> for betraying of <hi>Miletus, Lasthenes</hi> for de|liuering of <hi>Oli●thus, Nilo</hi> for selling of <hi>Epirus,</hi> and <hi>Apolloni|us</hi>
                     <pb facs="18"/>
for neglecting of his charge in <hi>Samos,</hi> are generally no|ted with the names of vnthankeful and vntrustie traytors to theyr cuntreyes: so that you must alwayes remember to become thankefull to your cuntrey, and myndefull to maynteyne the honor of the same, least neglecting your dueties in that behalfe, you deserue the oprobrious names of traytors, which are odius to God and man. You muste also spare no peril or trauaile to defende the same, for your countrey challengeth not onely that you be thankfull vn|to the soyle which hath bredde you, but furder also, that you defende the state, wherein you haue béene nourished. <hi>Tully,</hi> in his <hi>Tusculanes</hi> questions recyteth one <hi>Lascaena,</hi> who when he receiued tydings of his sounes death, whom he had sent into the warres in defence of hys countrey, answered: therefore did I beget him (quoth hee) that hée might be such an one, as woulde not doubt to dye for hys countrey. In his booke entytuled the dreame of <hi>Sipio,</hi> he af|firmeth that there is a certaine place appointed and ordei|ned in heaueu, for all such as defende their countrey. <hi>Euri|pides</hi> warneth that we shoulde neuer bee wearye in those trauailes, which tende to the restitution or defence of our countrey. <hi>Platoes</hi> opinion was, that wee are more bound to defend our countrey, then our own Parents▪ Like argu|mentes haue béene defended by many Phylo●ophers, say|ing, that although thy Parentes and proper family b● ouerthrowne, yet (the common welth of thy cuntrey stan|ding) thou mayst florishe and ryfe againe: but the state of thy countrey being ouerthrowne, both thou and thy Pa|rentes must lykewise come to vtter subuertion. Then as thou shalt fynde it thy bounden duety to honor thy country with all gratitude, and to defende it with all thy power, ●o must thou likewise endeuor thy selfe to be profitable to the same: whereof many notable examples might be rehersed. <hi>Lycurgus,,</hi> when he had by extréeme dilligence aud trauayle
<pb facs="18"/>
reduced the <hi>Spartanes</hi> vnto cyuillytie, by sundrie holsome lawes and pollityke constitutions, and that they began to murmure, saying: that his lawes were vntollerable, hée feyned that he woulde go to <hi>Delphos,</hi> to consulte with the God <hi>Apollo,</hi> whether his lawes were to be obserued or not promising to abide his sentence, &amp; requiring no more of the <hi>Lacedemonianes,</hi> but to sweare y^● they would obserue those lawes vntill his retourne: which when they had so|lemly sworne, tooke his iurney without entente to returne home againe, and ordeyned before his death, to be enclosed in a great chee● of Lead, and so to be throwen into the sea, to the ende that hée neuer retourning, the <hi>Laucede|monians</hi> might be bound by theyr othe to continue the ex|ercise of his profitable lawes, suche care he had to become profitable vnto his countrey. <hi>Curtius</hi> the <hi>Romayne,</hi> when there apeared a greate gulfe in the market place, whiche could by no meanes be stopped, and answere was géeuen from the Oracle, that it was onely to bee stopped by that which was of moste worth vnto the citye of <hi>Roome,</hi> he dée|ming that the cittie had nothing so precious, as stoute &amp; valyant men, armed him selfe, and leapte into the Gulfe, which stopped immediatly: declaring thereby, howe lyght men ought to estéeme theire life, when as the same maye yelde profitte or commoditie to theyr countrey. <hi>Meneci|us,</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Craeon,</hi> refused not voluntary death, when he vnderstoode that the same might redéeme the citye of <hi>Thebes</hi> from vtter subuersion. I might trouble you with infinite stories to proue this proposition, but let these few suffice, and in your countrie haue allways especiall re|specte to the elders, to whom you must also performe thrée seuerall deuties: that is, <hi>Reverence, Loue,</hi> and <hi>Defence. Lycurgus,</hi> ordeyned, that no young man should passe by an elder without reuerence fyrste doone vnto him, namelie if he were set, he rose to do reuerence vnto the elders, and if they were alone, he was bound to proffer them the com|fort
<pb facs="19"/>
of his company. <hi>Plato,</hi> in his nynth dyalogue of lawes and constitucions doth thus propound: al men must grant (sayth he) that age is much to be preferred before youth, aswell in the sight of God, as also in the sight of men, which will lyue orderly: for it is abhominable (sayth he) that an olde man shoulde geue place vnto an young man, and the Gods them selues do hate it, since youth ought with paciente mynde to beare euen the strypes of their el|ders. You shal also loue them, because of them you may learne good preceptes, and of them you may be bolde to aske councell: for as <hi>Euripides,</hi> in his tragedy called <hi>Phae|nissae,</hi> doth teache, prudence will not be gotten with fewe dayes seeking for, and the apostles teach vs our deuty dy|rectly in that behalf, who ordeyned amongst them elders in euery congregation, to decyde all matters in contro|uersie, of whome they were resolued of all doubtes in con|science. It shal also becom you to defend the elders from al vyolence and outrage, since it is a thing as comly and co|mendable to defende the weake, as it is glorious and try|umphant to ouercome the mightie: whereof I myght re|cite many famous examples out of the Romain histories, but I will partlie include the same in the dueties which you owe vnto your Parentes, which are also, <hi>Honor, Loue,</hi> and <hi>Reliefe.</hi> And of the first parte, although I might bring in sundry worthy examples, yet because the case is of it self familiar, I wil be briefe, and vse no other persuation then the expresse commaundement of God, who biddeth you to honor your Father and Mother, that your▪ dayes maye bée long in the land which the Lord your god hath giuen you. And Sain●t <hi>Paule</hi> in the sixt chapiter of his Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> sayth. Chyldren obay your Parents in the Lord, for that is right and wellpleasing to the Lorde. As he testi|fieth in the thirde chapiter to the <hi>Colossianes,</hi> you shall loue them also because you are engendred of their owne fleshe &amp; bloud, as also you may not forget your Mothers paines
<pb facs="19"/>
in bearing of you, you muste alwaies meditate in your minde, fyrst the cares which they haue had to preserue you from bodily perils in the cradell, from daunger of damp|nation by Godly education, from néede and hunger by ad|ministring things necessarie, and from vtter destruction by vigillant foresight &amp; Godly care: all these with infinit other things considered, you shall finde your selues boun|den by manyfolde occasions to loue your Parentes, and to be assistant vnto them in the necessities of their age. For well sayd that Poet, which affirmed that children were tenderly swadled in their cradels, to the ende they mighte susteyne their aged Parentes and supplie their wantes. Meruelous is the nature of the Storke, which féedeth the damme in age, of whom it selfe receiued nouriture béeing young in the neast. <hi>Tully</hi> in his booke of the answers of soth|sayers sayth, that nature in the beginning hath made an accord betwéene vs and our Parents, so that it were dam|nable not to cherish them. And to conclude, ther is nothing that can worse become a comon welth, then to sée y^● youth florish in prosperity which suffer their parents to perish for lack of any cōmodity. Now that I haue rehearsed vnto you asmuche as I thinke requisit, for the enstruction of your dueties, fyrst towardes god, and his ministers, next to the Kyng and his Magistrates, thirdely to your countrey and the Elders thereof and lastly towardes your Parentes: it shall not be amisse that you remenber of your selfe how you are the Temple of God, kéepe your selues holy there|fore in your conuersation, and vndefiled, for if our sauiour Christ did rigorously rebuke and expell the buyers &amp; sellers out of the outward Temple, how muche more will hée pu|nishe them which pollute and de●le the inwarde Temple of their bodies, and geue ouer their delight to concupiscence and van●es? thus may you for breuitie remember that you.</p>

                  <p>Sir to declare of your sonnes behauiour, trewly I haue neuer séene any thing to misselyke of them, neyther could I euer perceine that they were slowe in apprehending myne enstructions, but rather more for|ward then their brethren, true it is that here came one to me in name of the Markgraue, saying that he was theyr kinseman and very desirous to sée them, wherevpon I did willingly giue them leaue, and when they came ther they say that the messenger misse tooke the matter, and should haue gone to some other schollers. But doubtles my mind giueth me, that if they haue bene allured to any euill com|pany, it hath bene by that same fellow which came to mée on that message.</p>

                     <hi>Eccho?</hi> Nay then you haue not iudged a|misse, for it is one of the lewdest fellowes in this towne, a common Parasite and a seducer of youth.</p>

                  <p>Surely my harte did not greately like him at the first sight, but since thinges done cannot be vn|done, I lyke well that you should (according to your owne deuise) prouide in time before they wade déeper in such enterprises, and to speake mine opinion, you may doe wel to send them vnto some Uniuersity, before they haue fur|ther acquaintance or haunt in such company, for whether
<pb facs="32"/>
it be loue, or lust that hath infected them, there can be no presenter remedy then to absent them from the thinges which they desire, and therewithall I promise you (not to flatter) they are already very sufficiently able for the U|niuersity, and the en●ructions which I haue giuen them, may serue rather for precepts of their perfect duty to God and man, then for any exercise of the liberall sciences, wherein they are so wel entred, and haue bene so through|ly traded, as there lacketh nothing but conuenient place where they might procéede in Logike and such lyke.</p>

                  <speaker>Phylopaes.</speaker>
                  <p>And me thinkes we might better doe to en|fourme the Markgraue. Who vppon such meanes as we shall make, may banish the harlot with her traine out of the City, and may also punish the parasite for so entysing the younge men.</p>

                  <speaker>Gnomaticus.</speaker>
                  <p>I graunt you that all this maye be done ●ery well but then you are to consider, that the hartes of young men, are oftentimes so stout, that they can not abid publiquely to heare of a faulte, the which (being priuatlie and gentlely admonished) they woulde peraduenture wil|lingly amend: and great difference there is betwéene chil|dren and young men, for in childhoode all punishment is terrible, but in florishing youth euery punishment may not be vsed, but discretion must foresee what kynde of punishment wil most preuaile and best gayne reformati|on in the mind of the offender. Wherefore myne aduice shoud be that you send them to some Uniuersitie, and as neare as you can forsée to place them with such a Lutor as may alwaies haue an eye to their exercises, and may haue especiall care how they shall bestow their vacant tymes. For idlenesse is the cause of many e●ils in youth, whereas beeing occupied or exercised in any thing that is verteous or commendable, they shall not haue so great oc|casion to thinke of vanities.</p>

Well I will go talke with their parentes, and if they wilbe ruled by my councell, they shall giue them leaue a little to see the world, and to followe any exercise that be not repugnant vnto vertue, for vnto some wittes neyther correction, nor frendly ad●tion, nor any other perswasi●n will serue, vntil their owne rodde haue beaten them, and then they proue oftentymes (though late) men of excellent qualities. But beholde where they come to dis|charge me of this trauaile.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Seuerus.</speaker>
                  <p>Surely I haue done my best (in discharge of my duty) to apprehend them, and I haue examined them also, but truly I can not finde hitherto any proofe against them, whereby they ought to be punished: and though I desire (as much as you) to sée them condingly corrected, yet with out proofe of some offence I should therin commit a wrong. True it is that <hi>Eccho</hi> is knowen commonly in this Town for a Parasite and a flattering fellow, and the young wo|man also doth not séeme to be of the honestest, but yet there is no body which will come in and say this or that I haue séene or knowen by her. Shée confesseth that <hi>Phylosarchus</hi> and <hi>Phyl●us</hi>●re there one night at a banquet, and that <hi>Phylosarchus</hi> should haue supped there the same night that they were taken, and when I aske her to what end, she an|swereth that he was a suter to her for mariage, and for witnesse bringeth in her Aunt as good as her selfe, in the meane time I haue no proofe of euill wherwith to burthen her. And then maister <hi>Eccho</hi> (on that other sid) he 〈◊〉 as stiffe as may be, and saith that he knoweth not whether <hi>Phylos●us</hi> should haue supped there or not, and for lack
<pb facs="50"/>
of proofe I am able to go no furder.</p>

                  <p>There was one <hi>Dicke Droom</hi> a companion of <hi>Ecchoes,</hi> which came vnto them and tolde them the whole discourse, wherevppon they fledde with him immediately.</p>

                  <p>Such a one was presente in déede when <hi>Eccho</hi> was taken, and because mine officers knew him not, nor had any commission to search for him, therefore they suffe|red him to departe.</p>

                  <p>Out vppon him, I would to God they had made him safe also, for he hath bin the casting away of <hi>Phylautus. Phylautus, Phylosarcus, Dick Droom</hi> with my frend <hi>Ambidex|ter</hi> here, went out of <hi>Doway</hi> together, and bicause my mais|ters charge was that I should followe where so euer they went, I followed as fast as I could by enquiry, and with in thrée or foure dayes iourney, I heard that <hi>Phylosarcus</hi> by the helpe of this good companion <hi>Ambidexter</hi> had gotten a fair minion for sooth, and stayed with her at <hi>Brusselles,</hi> fron● whence <hi>Phylautus</hi> and <hi>Dycke Droom</hi> departed, and tooke

their wa● togither vp towardes <hi>Germany,</hi> now <hi>Phylosarchus</hi> and his cari●ge held their way (as it was saide) towardes <hi>〈◊〉</hi> W●n I sawe that they were so par●ed, and that I could not followe both companies at once, I thought best to holde on my way towardes the Palsgraues Court, &amp; hoped that by the way I might yet chance to heare of <hi>Phy|●tus,</hi> and in very deede I heard of such a one at sundrie places, and at last I heard of him expressedly, for the day before I came to the Palsgraues Court, he was there e●e|cuted for a robbery with <hi>Dicke Droom,</hi> yea euen in sight of his Brother, and notwithstanding the fauour that hee is in there, such seuere execution of iustice is there admi|nistred.</p>

When I perceyued that none other issue could be had of my trauaile, I tooke letters from <hi>Phylotimus,</hi> and sought no further after <hi>Phylosarchus,</hi> but thought my duty first to ad|uertise my maister of the certainty, and by my way home|wardes I ouertooke this good fellowe <hi>Ambidexter</hi> in such a|ray as you sée, and haue brought him with me to abide such punishment as the worthy Markgraue here and other ma|gistrates shall thinke meete for him.</p>
