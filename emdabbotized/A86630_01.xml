<hi>Thetis,</hi> and croſſed by two potent Rivalls,

by the Counſells of <hi>Chiron,</hi> and by the

are at the end excluded of their pretentions;
<hi>Neptune</hi> deſiſts by reaſon of his old age, and
<hi>Jupiter</hi> being the elder of the two, but much more conſiderable,
doth voluntarily renounce his intereſt. Whereupon <hi>Thetis</hi> being
plainely perſwaded of the conſtancy, and fidelity of her Lover, gives
her conſent to marry him, ſo the Nuptialls are celebrated with a
great concourſe of Gods and Goddeſſes. <hi>Prometheus</hi> alſo having
done good ſervice in the buſineſs, and to put a period to his troubles,
is there alſo preſent, and brings with him the Liberall and Mecha|nick
Arts which hee had invented; Diſcord alſo would faine have
been there, but that ſhe was aſhamed to appeare upon the theatre,
having been chac'd out of <hi>France,</hi> and it had been to no purpoſe for
her to diſturb ſo ioyfull a meeting.</p>

                  <p>Touching the firſt, the Fancy comming from

in your <hi>Illuſtrious</hi> blood as <hi>England,</hi> I humbly
conceived it might well become your Ladiſhip to
be Patroneſſe thereof.</p>

a number of Princes, Princeſſes, Nobles, and a|bove
a hundred Repreſentators beſides, ſo that
the charge of the ſcene and ſhewes amounted to
half a million of French liures; But above all, it
being an invention ſo cryed up, ſo well contriv'd
and trac'd, ſo full of wit, and variety of Muſicall
airs, with other <hi>gentileſſes;</hi> I deem'd it would be a
thing not unworthy of your Ladiſhips private en|tertainment.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Madam, the Fancy being ſo <hi>freſh,</hi> and
ſutable to the <hi>ſeaſon,</hi> it comes to uſher in a hap|py
