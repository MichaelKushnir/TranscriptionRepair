                           <p>Yes Sir, to Mr. <hi>Saveall</hi> your Unkles friend: But hee has ſtood your friend ſo long, and ſo often, to ſo little purpoſe in moving your Unkle for you, that he holds it utterly in vaine, to urge him any further, he told me.</p>

                           <p>Then would he ha' told me againe, what all your courſes have been.

Though all your Arts of borowing are croſt out of all Mens Bookes before you offer at 'em, while your old Debts ſtand fairely written, and all your Marts miſcarry of putting out for credit, Veniſon to Citizens, or early Cherries, Codlings and Apricocks to their Wives availe you nothing, cannot ſomething yet be found?</p>

Yet is it obſerv'd in her that ſhee has a violent humour to do, and not to doe things often|times wilfully againſt all good councell or perſwaſion, ſhee has the ſpirit of contradiction in her, and an unal|terable reſolution upon ſodaine intentions, a moſt incor|rigible will ſhee has that will not bow nor breake. This croſſe abuſive Letter therefore may doe good upon her,
<pb facs="28"/>
however miſchievous hee might intend it. If ſhee meant well to him before, it may the faſter bring her on, but it amazes me that hee ſhould write ſo, bearing his Unkle, and my ſelfe in hand, that hee ſo fairely lov'd her, and beſought us to negotiate with her for him, ſhould ſhee forgive it, yet the wrong to us in his vile manners is un|pardonable, and ſo ſir, I come to you.</p>

You would have a child by him. All your Cawdells and Cock-broaths will never doe it, An old mans generative ſpirit runs all into braine, and that runs after covetouſneſſe too, get wealth, not children. Believe it, much Nephews helpe belongs to it, and then the chil|dren are not degenerate, I cannot thinke but many Unkles know it, and give way to it, becauſe ſtranger bloods ſhall not inherit their Lands, and ſo ſweet Aunt if I live not to inherit his, my ſon may, in your firſt born. There will be a ſweet comfort to you.</p>

There was no hurt meant, but the ſlap I gave him over the Pate to colour the buſineſſe, with little blood, I wiſh now I had cleft his braines.</p>
