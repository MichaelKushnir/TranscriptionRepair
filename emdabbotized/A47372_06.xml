                        <p>WHat? The death of the brave General has begot discourse and change in <hi>Madrid;</hi> I hear the Action too, though most Noble, traduo'd by his Enemies; Wretches that durst not look upon the dangers his gal|lant Mind broke through daily: Their Envy will not let him find peace in his Grave neither.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Johan.</speaker>
                        <p>That cloud is dispers'd now; 'tis true, at first we had the report of a total rout, and that the Enemy advanc'd to <hi>Pam|palone,</hi> with which the affrighted people began to fall into some passion against him, who had been so unlucky as to command that day.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <pb n="314" facs="160"/>
                        <speaker>Carlo.</speaker>
                        <p>But when they were for certain inform'd of the following Action, How, contrary to all hope, he had engag'd and stop'd the Enemy, and at the rate of his own life purchas'd their safety by throwing himself into certain dangers, The whole City lamented his loss, and he has been honour'd and mourn'd for as a General Parent.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Pedro.</speaker>
                        <p>And with Justice he might expect it; for <hi>Decius</hi> fell not more vow'd the Roman Deliverer, then our General a sacrifice for his Country; But he is gone, and with him a Souldier, and such a one, <hi>Johanne,</hi> as his Enemies both admir'd and fear'd; We shall see how his Successour will redeem those miseries we are fallen into by his Envy and opposition of the dead General in all his designe●.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Johan.</speaker>
                        <p>Of this some other time, when we have pay'd those joyes are due to the return of our Friend and Patron; Who if he hold his good humour still, there is news in Town will concern him much much more; The famous <hi>Paduana, Angelica Bianca.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <speaker>Pedro.</speaker>
                        <p>Who? The Italian, our dea● General brought from <hi>Main?</hi> What of her?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Johan.</speaker>
                        <p>The same; She is now the discourse of the whole Town; all the youth in <hi>Madrid</hi> dress themselves for her sake; Their Horses prance in no street but hers, hers are the Colours they all wear in the <hi>Prado;</hi> Where her Coach drives there is the dust, there is the throng; No song in fashion but her praise, her Story is the Theam of all the Muses in the Town.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Pedro.</speaker>
                        <p>Prithe● be quick and serious this is strange to me; Why now more then when her Patron liv'd?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Johan.</speaker>
                        <p>That's the news; Know then, since the Generals death she is exposed to sale; Her price and Picture hangs upon the door, where she sits in publick view drest like <hi>Aurora,</hi> and breaks like the day from her window; She is now the subject of all the Love and Envy of the Town▪ 'tis sport to hear the Men sigh for, and the Women rail at her. And if Don <hi>Pedro</hi> be a Lover still, there is no need of Fayries, old Women, or Confessors, to deliver or return a Message; Now 'tis but so much a Moneth, and you are Patron; four dayes and nights in the week are yours.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Pedro.</speaker>
                        <p>You amaze me; 'tis true, I Love the Girl with all the passion youth can with Honour spare one of her humour; (but no farther) And if money or a sword can purchase her. I'll bid as faire a● another but I'll enjoy her.</p>

                        <p>You are patient men; keep to one Wench a year! I would wear one shirt, one pair of shooes, or eat of one dish as soon as let the Sun set twice upon the same sin of their form in my com|pany; I would flea a kennel of Spanniels in the Dog-days as soon, for the Quarrey and skins of the vermin; I dare say, I have had a hundred since; all prais'd and ador'd by some body, though for|got by me; such Saints as these I could never pray to; there is none of them have any charms in their eyes, no fear nor terror in their frowns, nor can their kindness surprize a heart; I never found my self grow greater, or less in my mind, when they were pleas'd, or angry, unsavory, flat, insippid beauties, <hi>good meals meat, but no Feasts;</hi> no Banquet in their faces, <hi>Carlo;</hi> there's no Musick in their Caresses, no Empire in ruling over such hearts; yet 'tis truth, <hi>Sa|retta</hi>'s voice and humour is good, and her skin not ill, but <hi>she is dull;</hi> a soul that neither youth nor beauty can awake; she only works in her trade, and sells so much love; a dull sufferer only, <hi>no acting party</hi> in the Bed.</p>

I am for <hi>Saretta,</hi> 'tis a brave plump Girle, there's substance in her; her heart has room to dance and play in her brest; the Rogues soul lyes soft and white; and in these Dog-days to lye in her arms is sleeping in <hi>Fresco;</hi> your lean women in the Summer burn like kindled Char-coal, I must find some means to purchase a sin, or so with her.

jealousie made me lye hid in the world, neither seen nor enjoy'd; chaster then their Nunneries had my mind been as innocent as his Bed. Profit and to be sought was all my pleasure then, with which profit I will seek my pleasure now; the doubtful world searce believ'd I was handsome: thus I shall remove that doubt, and leave a name and memory behind me; the novelty and hu|mour, besides the price, will beget discourse; I know there's few will give the money, though he is not born shall enter under; for though I want no money, I'll have the <hi>gusto</hi> to see them gaze, sigh and wish for what they have not the hearts to purchase, nor merit to deserve, <hi>gratis;</hi> and when our nine days wonder's over, we'l be|gone; and in our own Sphear enjoy all our souls can imagine of peace and pleasure; get the <hi>Theorbo,</hi> I see some coming.</p>

                        <p>'Tis a fellow of a most temperate soul; one that makes his own humours his slaves, and himself a slave to all other mens; I have known him long and in divers Countries, a kind admirer still of the place and people he was in; as if it had been his own Country or Family; and 'tis thought he can live in all Countries but that he was born in; one of his maximes is, No man has wit that cannot be what he will, upon all occasions, in all companies, and in all conditions; <hi>Harrigo</hi> knows him better then I.</p>

Bread and water I can digest in a fur|row upon a Rendevouz, and sleep in it, without thoughts of Envy, till an Alarm wake me; And then start up from among those Clouds, when the Trumpet sounds, as if 'twere Doomsday; Custome and Honour, <hi>Hall,</hi> makes that sufferance nothing; Nor has ambition or Fortune any Beauties, that tempt me; But as they can purchase Beauty, which we see set at a Rate, like Flesh in the Shambles, and spoil'd too, like that, by ill Cooks.</p>

                        <p>Rather, why did you set it up, If not for that purpose? sure you know the excellence it expos'd to our Eyes; which I would now describe, but that the conversation with your Glass will do it better, which I perceive you have con|sulted, by the price you seem to value them at; In short, I saw and lov'd you, fair one, as who do's not; I wish'd for you too, as who would not? But when I read your paper, I found the price of this Jewel too great, not for my value but my Fortune; had that been equal to my Love, you should have found at what rate I priz'd the Beauty and the Friendship of the famous and fair <hi>Angellica,</hi> that Star of <hi>Italy;</hi> who had she been as fixt as bright, a Prince might have worne such a Jewel in his Breast, and receive greatness and lustre from her; These thoughts my wounded Eyes, and ravish'd Ears, suggested to me seeing that Form, and hearing those charmes thy hand and voice dispers'd amongst the surpriz'd, and sighing multitude; When guilty of my own condition I despair'd any success with my Alms-mony, to think of purchasing your per|son; <stage>Angellica <hi>is serious and attentive to all he sayes.</hi>
                           </stage> And therefore I resolved at all hazard to possess this shadow to feast my Eyes with, and to kiss and imagine kindness for it.—You smile now, and look upon my Cloaths, and despise me be|cause I am poor.</p>

                        <p>Yes, yes, I see it and can bear it; Yet, in these old Cloaths I am a Gentleman and a Souldier; and though my habit be ill, my heart and my sword are good, and I think my Repu|tation, as any Souldier needs; for though I have lost my Fortune, yet I have preserv'd mine Honour still.</p>

                        <p>Nay, I have told you I can endure it, if you despise me, so you do not tell me of it; But what's all this to you, who are fair, young and lovely, and indeed Mistriss of all the Virtues depraved man seeks? Good Heaven! What faults have I seen Wealth and Beauty hide! Even Princes flatter faces, and wink at the sins and crimes they commit; and while Riches break the Nets, Beauty numbs the Fishers hands: Riches weighs down the scale, while Poverty lies open to the Law and censure, liable to the scorn and punishment; for though all are taught to know the pe|nalty of the Law, 'tis the poor man is made the example.</p>

                        <p>No, no, let her vent her spleen, for the same question is in your heart too, onely you can be so discreet as to hide it; What would you have? Who are you? One that scornes to play your parts; and though I dare spend my blood, I scorn to sell it for so base sallary; No, not to enjoy you, though I avow a Love and admiration for thee, and would run any hazard to purchase thee; See here the last sum I can command upon the earth, the last meal I know where to eat now in my Body, when this money is gone; Yet I am such a servant to Love and Beauty, this last, last hope, I'll freely give to enjoy thee; here, pray take it, I conjure you take it. Do not scorn me, fair one, now I have said this; For know, <stage>She turns from him.</stage> if you do, I can hate at as great a rate as I can love; and for my Revenge, not onely give this last penny, but hazard the last drop of my blood too: Why are you coy to me? I know you are to be had, and would be mine had I money to purchase you; 'tis printed, and by your own Order publish'd; Which Cordial, I'll still repeat to my heart, that knowledge has a virtue, and in time will heal these wounds; Never frown, fair one; I would not for the earth thy Fame were as fair as thy face.</p>

                        <p>Not that I despise you, but to secure my self; All those flames I feel now are but so many Lusts, I know them by their suddain bold intrusion; The impatiency and the sawciness of the flame betrayes it, still devouring till it be devoured; had it been Loves pure dart, I should have pin'd at your feet in silence, ere found a daring to tell you so. Lust his bastard-brother, and born of the same Mother, can brook a denial of that which Love dares not ask, and onely grows angry for a time; But the next kind Girl quenches his flame.</p>

                        <p>After all this severe truth, what are we guilty of that you have not confess'd? What crime staines us that you would not now act? You men are strangely partial to your selves, you would not despise us else; Is the fault single in us? If not, why should we lose our Honours in the Act, when you think it an Honour to be the Actors? Who made the Law against Love? Or where will you find it obligeth women onely? If the Law be general, must not the crime be so too?</p>

                        <speaker>Thomaso.</speaker>
                        <p>Yes, in Love; for Love 'tis equal, but not in you, because you will be paid; you sell your blood which is your guilt: 'Tis Mercenarines in you that makes the sin, Nature else would plead for you too; When I hang out my picture, and at a rate expose my self to all comers, then I will not wonder if you despise me.</p>

                        <p>And I could urge, when you'll take a House and furnish it, deliver up your Youth and Liberty a slave to our Sex, and wait like a spider in your web, for all flies that pass; When <hi>Angellica</hi> knocks at your door, and leads you to your bed, I will not wonder if you ask a price before I enjoy you; Nor ought you to wonder when we desire some satisfaction for the slavery we suffer.</p>

Well.

                        <p>Nay, then a Whores fortune and my curse befall thee; have we spun and stich'd, dress'd and watch'd for this? is all the honey we suck'd from so many flowers in their youth carri'd to that hive, for this Droan to waste? What curse made me consent to her vanity! a thousand Crowns, a fine plot to leave a fame be|hind us! what a stink will this story make in <hi>Venice?</hi> a curse on this Caterpillar; by that time she hath cloath'd and fed him, we may resolve to go naked our selves; there's but one remedy left, Best rob her my self, while she hath something to steal; I may keep her when she is old; well, I begin to think this is no good trade we drive, 'twill thrive neither Whore nor Baud; I have been as painful in either calling as any she in <hi>Venice;</hi> my youth had as much beauty and as powerful friends; and my age as much thrift, <hi>Anna Garbota,</hi> says one <hi>Anna Spiritata,</hi> says another, <hi>Anna Bellama|na,</hi> says a third, <hi>Assasina, Echephorbe, Calladora,</hi> these were my names; then <hi>Anna</hi> who had higher fame! yet see all these trophees shrunk into one poor Baud and these ruines: who admires but to mora|lize upon them? and now to add to the afflictions of my age, in my age this curse is fall'n upon me; 'twould make one swear to be poor and honest to see such luck as follows me; Love was al|ways fatal to our trade; but I did not fear this curious mischief, to dote upon a Beggar, a Souldier-beggar, a trade as ill as our own, as poor too, and as impossible to be made rich; one that thinks it a dishonour to get or save; we shall never eat again neither, for he'l have all in drink; nay, 'tis an English Souldier too, and one of the Kings party, three titles to perpetual poverty; a race of men who have left praying, or hoping for daily bread; and only relye upon nightly drink.</p>

                        <p>Methinks that race of Cavaliers should be extinct or quiet at least; they have been kill'd or banish'd, sunk, hang'd and starv'd this thirteen years, and yet they swarm still; I pitied them at first.</p>

                        <p>Pity'em, hang'em, they are as proud of their persecuti|on as the Jews; and brag as vainly of their wants as a Castillian would of his blood; no servants, no money, no clothes, no meat, and always afoot, neither daunts nor dejects them; they beg as confidently their surly way, and they think as meritoriously as Ca|puchins; By this light, I believe 'twill be an order in time, they are admitted into the Mendicants already; and those that lov'd the man least call'd their great <hi>Charles</hi> both Saint and Martyr, and the Rogues hope yet to make a black-red-day for him in their Ka|lender; their Princes too look as high, and charge as far still up|on one lean Mare, as if they had a hundred led-horse behind them; and their Duke too fights now in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> as his Brother did in <hi>Scotland;</hi> at the old <hi>Rupert</hi> rate, ten to one still; And by this hand they look so above the rest of men, for all their calamities, that when they past last through <hi>Flanders</hi> no man durst be heard to pity them, for fear some one of his dull honest ones should mi|stake that pity and strike him.</p>

                        <p>I, but that humour's chang'd now, <hi>France</hi> has so cut their Combs; the <hi>Louvre</hi> and the Pale-royal have been sad inchanted Castles to them, they have kept a <hi>Lazarello</hi>'s Court there; dark|ness, loanness, and the nest of poverty; but two loaves a day, and without fish, to work the Miracle; yet the Gallery was a Christi|an Coney-warren fill'd with Cavaliers of all Trades; and unless they fed upon their children, 'tis not visible what they eat.</p>

                        <p>They are now remov'd to the Palace Royal, where they eat so seldom, and dung so small, you may as soon step in a Custard as a T—in the Court; they that do S—save it for their own Pig; there is not a blade of Grass left in the Garden, nor a drop of Oyl in the <hi>Madona</hi>'s Lamp; sacriledge and their Sallads make it burn dim, they are happy that swim, they dive in the pond and steal the Fish. The younger stomacks browse upon the Cops as high as they can reach, they have starv'd the poor Antelope in eating up his Commons; their Grandees only dine, and that but when for|tune smiles: the Grashoppers are grown Pismires now, and are abroad as early as the day, and industrious as the Ant, for food. Brown-bread and old <hi>Adams</hi>'s Ale is currant now; yet if little <hi>Eve</hi> walk in the Garden, the lean starv'd Rogues neigh after her as if they were in Paradise; there's their Resident too, his Arms are up still; but 'tis long since he had the Supporters; 'tis thought he eat the Unicorn last Passover, his Butcher and he are still in process

for the horn; the Lyon's lean too, but he will never be tame; you may see the Royal Beast still in the Fair; and I have heard an Irish Capuchin swear (for he is a blade too, though in a gray scabbard) that if the Cavaliers could be brought to pray as well as fast, he believ'd the King would yet have more Saints in his Army then St. <hi>Ignatius</hi> has Lamps burn dim.</p>

Prithee tell me, where hadst thou the Sack we drank at Dinner;
<pb n="346" facs="176"/>
The Eloquent, Bold, Fortunate Sack we drank to day? say, that I may go kiss the spiggot, and kneel to the Butt; 'Tis Sacred Liquor, I'll <hi>dip my Beads in't,</hi> and then touch all things that I would have kind or happy with them.</p>

                        <p>French Wine? not I, 'tis the Omen of some ill luck when I drink it; French wine? when would that Corrasive had such success? No, I abjure it; Satyres, and ill Nature, Costiveness, and narrow soul, shrunk heartedness, and ill luck follow'd me as long as I convers'd with that hungry juice; Cheerful Oyly Sack, you see, has in an hour of happy Minutes crown'd all my wishes; I have not one desire left; Prithee let's be all wanton, and think upon something to want, Heark? Here's those Friends will remove all difficulties—Heark, how they dance out of tune for Joy to be fallen into my hands; That while we have the pleasure of spend|ing, these little Rogues may have the Gusto to be spent? 'tis He and She Gold while 'tis here, and begets young pleasures; The fruit shews their beauty, while the covetous savor, with severe Eyes, keeps them Imprison'd in their Chests; they have no opportunity to meet, but lie barren; The separated Sexes for want of use wither, without putting forth either Leaf or Fruit; Or will you Collation, or Sup with me at our house? I am serious, all's mine own, and you shall be well-come.</p>

                        <p>If he had a passion, as my Brother believes, yet I am cer|tain, 'twas but a Passenger in his heart, no Native, nor Dweller there, some sudden kindness to himself, some complacency and Incli|nation <hi>Incognita,</hi> that never appear'd, still without the Garb of a gallant Love, such as is fit for a Maid to take notice of; else I should have seen it, he still appear'd to me of a Nature so Indifferent as if he car'd not to Conquer, which made me always think him not worth the being overcome; and so I lost him e're I found him and if some one, more concern'd then either of us, had not miss'd him before me, he had vanished like his Shadow; This, Sir, is all the Account I can give you of one who was never thought of when he was present.</p>

                        <p>Sir, I am your Sister, and one that has as much value and kindness for you as any Brother can pretend to; and 'tis grounded upon so much reason, that were you not my Brother I should still Honour you; For I believe Don <hi>Pedro</hi>'s humour and nature's such, as may justly pretend to an esteem from any virtuous woman: But I would not see you presume upon the ill customs of our Countrey so far as to make a slave of your Sister, who, if you will be just to her, will give you greater power then you can ask without blushing.</p>

                        <p>Encourag'd by your kindness I shall try my Interest in a small request; I ask not to be preferr'd before the world; I onely beg to be rank'd in your esteem with Don <hi>Thomaso;</hi> Why do you frown and blush? Is there any guilt belongs to the Name of that Wanderer?</p>

                        <p>His private return to this Town will authorize my fears; and my cares and love of you will exact this question from you, when you shall know I met him to day in Town. Why this con|fusion?</p>

                        <p>You mistake me, Sir; I am not at all confounded with the News, nor asham'd of any esteem I have for him; My value sprung at first from that praise your self and my Father gave him. Then Honour, Justice, and Gratitude, made me his Debtor, being forgot and abandoned by all, and expos'd to such dangers as the licenc'd Lust of common Souldiers threaten; When Rage and Con|quest flew through the City, ruining all that was virtuous, Then <hi>Thomaso,</hi> this Wanderer, came and saved me; for which action my Soul has a high value for him; Nor will I blush to say it to you, though I never said so much to him, who has ever paid me an hum|ble and a civil respect since that action, which no time nor absence shall deface: 'Twas gallant to all men, and particular to me, who, when a Father and a Brother could forget me, left a prey to the first comer voluntarily, and for my sake threw himself into all dangers to redeem me; That Wanderer did this, that Wanderer that sav'd my Life and Honour; and <hi>Serulina</hi> has so much virtue as to prefer him and his Friendship before any frowns or Fortune whatsoever.</p>

                           <hi>Calis</hi> was ever faithful, and shall allways find me kind; and if I live she shall not say I am ingrateful; 'Tis now St. <hi>Cecilia</hi>'s Eve, his own Feast, get our veils, and let us go in disguise to the <hi>Caletravo</hi>'s; There's the great Musick to morrow, and we shall certainly meet him at the <hi>Vespers;</hi> He was alwayes a devote to the fair <hi>Cecilia,</hi> and Dona <hi>Francisca;</hi> Musick was ever his delight, but their voices especially; If I meet him there I shall tell him of his danger; and if he be false, of some which do not threaten yet; But till I am certain he is false, it shall not lie in the power of Ma|lice to blast his hopes; I know his humour is wild; and for his Love of Women, 'tis upon his own score; he that can be kind and constant to his women so against the hair, as he is, in spight of Law, conscience, or his own profit, buying at all rates their kindness, when he do's not so much as hope they should really love him; What a friend would this man be, when all these, and Love to boot, shall seek him, and if found oblige him? He must either change his Nature, or Love me too; Come, <hi>Calis,</hi> I am resolv'd in two lines to write him what we hear, and something of what they would have me fear, which I cannot do; For he that had virtue enough to prefer her before Fortune, quitting his Country for his Honour, shall never want my Fortune nor my Friendship, when it can serve such a Virtue.</p>

                        <p>Don <hi>John</hi> has ever been honour'd by my Father and his Family, and I shall be proud to find I have not lost that value he had once for his Daughter; and to confirm him in my esteem of him, I shall satisfie him 'tis no blind willful passion, but an affection grounded upon reason which I profess (if love can have any rea|son in his sacrifice) besides those thousands which to day I gave my Brother; who if he found a froward answer must chide himself; for Love, <hi>Johanne,</hi> is a child; and if wak'd too rudely will be out of humour.</p>

                        <p>What his humour has been to day, or yesterday, I know not; I shall rather judge by those years I knew him, then by these few hours of which you accuse him; all his addresses to me were still full of humility, and had honour enough for any Maid to avow; nothing of the earthy, heavy, envious Lover, that eats his own heart, if I but praise another man; none of the watry ey'd, whyning sigher, that thinks to gain from a womans pity that fa|vour which he could not deserve or win from her Reason; none of your fiery, cholerick Lover neither, whose bloody rage speaks in his passion war and destruction; one that will frown and look pale upon a Mistress, as if he would win that heart by force and storm, which he has no title to by love or vertue; no, Don <hi>John,</hi> none of these, nor your aiery Humorist, your Dresser, Singer, Fencer, Horse-man, Dancer, Poet; all the all that all women, in all men, admire, I can prize, but it shall not slave me; had <hi>Thomaso</hi> lov'd the common way of men, I would have paid him with ordinary fa|vours; and for his Mistresses, that great crime so often urg'd by my Brother and your self, I despise it, and inquire neither who, nor how many he has; I scorn to fear he can be such a fool as to give them his heart; and for his body, 'twas always the least of my thoughts, and only known as it went and came upon Loves Er|rands betwixt us; and she that is concern'd in her servants bestow|ing his body till he is hers, (were I the man) I should believe such an anger were but darkly telling me she had a mind to it her self; come <hi>Johanne,</hi> let <hi>Thomaso</hi> keep his heart and mind fit for my value; let them be chaste, and for his body I shall never consider what it doth.</p>

                        <p>Jealousie is, no doubt, a sign of Love; but 'tis not of the man I am jealous; I would be as soon jealous of my Cook or Keeper, as of my Lovers person; for they have flesh of mine in keeping too; yet I allow jealousie both proper and honourable in your sex; and were it not troblesome I would wish it in my servant; for it is fit he should be jealous, not only of my heart and person, but every word, look and motion is worth his fear and care; for a Virgin once blown upon by the world, or touch'd in reputation, is for ever stain'd; and yet this stranger, this jealous Lover, the eldest son of Love, is by foolish women traduc'd, and his birth-right de|ny'd him.</p>

'Tis not the Grape, the Melon, the Peach, will always please; no, nor the old Apple it self; and though few women can deserve one gallant friendship, yet none are contented with a hundred: All would have all, nor do they care so much to be lov'd, as to have it said so; they dress, Feast and Court for the vogue of the Town; and you will find in the Herd a hundred brace of fools, and not one pair of Lovers; though I will hope you may find <hi>Thomaso</hi> one; upon your score, Madam, I shall serve him; I beg your pardon, Madam; your Bro|ther <stage>She steps into an Arbour, and lyes down.</stage> expects me before this.</p>

                        <p>MOst Illustrious Dons, and egregiously beautiful and vertuous Madona's, with the rest of my Gentle friends and Auditors; Behold your humble and most officious Servant <hi>Lopus,</hi> arrived from the most ancient and stately City of <hi>Saragosa,</hi> on purpose to make a Present of the wonderful effects of his Phy|sical and Chymical Arts to your fair acceptance, in this most glo|rious and Courtly Town of <hi>Madrid;</hi> I protest to you, Gentlemen, I and my wife, with all my Servants, are not able to make of this Precious Oyl you see in this Glass, half so fast, as it is fetch'd a|way from my Lodging, by Gentlemen and others of this famous Town; and sent for by many of the greatest Dukes and Condees of this much celebrated Nation; Some of which have detain'd me to their private and particular use awhile, since my arrival, by their splendidous Liberalities; And worthily, for what avails it your rich man to have his Cellars stuffd with the purest grape; and his Tables furnish'd with the rarest variety of dainty Acates, when his Physitians prescribe him (on pain of death) to drink nothing but water-gruel, or over-stewed herbs, in a thin heartless Broth? O health, the blessing of the Rich, the Riches of the poor! who can buy thee at so dear a rate, since they cannot enjoy any happines in this world without thee? Be not then so sparing of your purses, Honourable Gentlemen, as to abridge the natural course of your lives; For when a humid Flux, or Catarrh, by the mutability of the Air, falls from your head into an Arm or Shoulder, or any o|ther part; take you a Ducat or Castilion of Gold, and apply it to the Place affected, see what good it will do; No no, It is this bles|sed Unguento, this rare Extraction, that onely hath the power to disperse all malignant humours, from whatsoever ill affected Cau|ses they shall proceed. It has power to fortifie the most indigest and crude stomack in the world, though it be of one that (through extreme weakness) vomits bloud; Applying onely a warm Nap|kin to the place, after the Unction and Fricace; for the Vertigo in the head, putting but a drop into your Nostrils, likewise behind your Ears, a most Sovereign and approved remedy. The Mal Ca|duco, Cramps, Convulsions, Paralysies, Epilepsies, Tremor Cordis, retired and shrunk Nerves, evil vapours of the Spleen, stoppings of the Liver, the Stone, the Strangury, <hi>Hermia ventosa, Iliaca pas|sio,</hi> stops a Dysenteria, immediately easeth the Tortion of the small guts, and cures Melancholia Hypochondriaca, being taken and ap|plyed according to my printed Receipt; For this is the Physitian, this the Medicine; this Counsels, this Cures; this gives the Directi|on, this works the effect; And in Sum, both together may be termed an Abstract of the Theorick and Practick in the Aescula|pian

Art; The price is but four Royalls, that is the price, and less I know, in curtesie you cannot offer me; take it, or leave it; How|soever, both I and it are at your service; I ask you not neer the va|lue of the thing; For then I should ask you a thousand Duckets; so several Grandees and Grandessa's have given me. But I despise money, onely to shew my affection to you, Honourable Gentlemen, and this most inclyte Town; I have neglected the Messages of di|vers Princes and Nobles, and directed my Journey hither, onely to present you with the fruits of my experience, and travels.</p>
                        <p>I have here likewise a most inestimable water, or Quintessence of Spirits drawn from all sorts of Medicinable Vegetables, which is equally to be valued with my Oyl; of Both which if I had but time to discourse to you the miraculous effects, with the Countless Catalogue of those I have cured of the aforesaid, and many more diseases, the Patents and Priviledges of the most Catholick and Christian Kings; as also of all the Princes and Commonwealths of Christendom; or but the depositions that have appeared, on my part, before the most learned Colledges of Physitians, where I was Authorized, upon notice taken of the admirable virtues of my Me|dicaments and my own excellency in matter of rare and unknown secrets, to disperse them publickly for the common good. And though divers have professed to have as good and experimented Receipts as my self, and have assayed to make both of this Oyl and water; Bestowed great cost in Furnaces, Stills, Alembicks, conti|nual fires, and preparation of Ingredients (as indeed there goes to each of them six hundred several Simples, at least,) yet they ever lost their labour and cost, both, for want of that large Talent of knowledge, requisite to such a work. For my self, I have always hunted after the most recondite secrets, and to get them. I have spared no rest, or labour, but taken indefatigable pains therein; Insomuch as, Gentlemen, I will undertake (by vertue of Chymical Art) out of the Honourable Hat that cov●●s your head to extract the four Elements, that is to say, Fire, Air, Water, and Earth, and return you the Felt without burn or Stain; For, whil'st others have been at the Balloo I have been at my Book, and am now pass'd the craggy parts of Study, and come to the flowery plains of Honour and Reputation.</p>
                        <p>Here is likewise a Powder conceal'd in this Paper, of which, if I should speak to the worth, five thousand volumns were but as one Page, that Page as a Line, that Line as a word; so short is this Pilgrimage of Man (which some call Life) to the expressing of it. Or if I would reflect upon the Price, why the whole world were but as an Empire, that Empire as a Province, that Province as a Bank, that Bank as a private purse, to the purchase of it. I will onely tell you; It is the very Powder that made <hi>Venus</hi> a Goddess, (given her by <hi>Apollo)</hi> that kept her perpetually young, clear'd her wrinckles, firmed her gums, filled her skin, colour'd her hair; from her derived to <hi>Helen,</hi> and at the Sack of <hi>Troy</hi> unfortunately lost, till now in this our Age it was as happily recovered by a Stu|dious Antiquary, out of some ruines of <hi>Asia;</hi> who sent a Moyety
<pb n="362" facs="184"/>
of it to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> but much sophisticated: The rest, at this present, remains with me, extracted to a Quintescence; so that, wherever it but touches, in youth, it perpetually preserves; in Age restores the Complexion, Seats your Teeth (did they dance like Virginal Jacks) as firm as a wall, makes them white as Ivory, that were as black as Jeat; and with the addition of a most wonderful Bath, of my own preparation, It will tinct a gray hair pure Auburn, and make it grow so; make you cast your old harsh skin for one as fresh and smooth as <hi>Laeda</hi>'s, and so supple and quicken your Joynts and Nerves, as but seldom using it, you shall ever enjoy your juvenile Activities, Gustos, and total Abili|ties, to the Admiration of all that formerly knew you; Many other rare effects there are of this Powder and Bath, too tedious to reckon in this place; but whosoever has a mind to try them, if they please to repair to me at my lodging, shall be more par|ticularly informed. Onely this I shall add at this present; This Powder has likewise a wonderfull variety of Amorous effects be|longing to it, which are not here to be enumerated; And for my rare Oyl, thuogh I impart it to the Rich for mony, I often cure the Poor for God-sake.</p>

                           </stage> The anguish of their blowes refreshes my Memory; all the rest is a dream still; A pox on the unruly Sack; I would he were come back, I long to be in bed; Give me a Girl that loves me, I hate a gilded post that must be purchas'd; 'Tis a fine Girl, and pity she is cast away upon such a jealous Husband; 'tis a consolation to think upon her; The Rogues kisses taste still, the savour and the smack are in my Heart yet; and if the piece prove as good as the pattern, a night with her is worth all the dayes I ere spent at <hi>Tot|nam</hi> or <hi>Istington;</hi> How woollenly those Sisters look and feel to this Silken Girl! This dainty sinner wears no Coife nor Ear-wyers, to make her Luggs smell as sour as Runnet or a Dairy; Now do I call to mind how wretchedly I spent my Estate in the Country, to keep a Kitchin and a Hall stinking; I would I could prevail with her to go into <hi>Surry;</hi> we have Whore enough there, But we want some good example to employ the stock; This would be a dainty Plantation sinner; she has the finest odd Name to; our Parson would not have christn'd a Child ofit, because 'tis neither in the old nor new Law; The Rogue stayes long, 'tis late, and they have my supper within; If they should eat it now without me,
<pb n="367" facs="186"/>
the jest would be better then the feast; a <hi>disgracia</hi> would give my Comrades such a Theam to laugh upon; a man had better have fin'd twice for Sheriff, then endure their insolent wits in such a case. I hear one whistle.</p>

Marry God forbid such a curse as constancy should follow me; I'll leave that for your Anchorit-lovers, whom Matrimony has vow'd to some old womans Cellar of threescore; there the sin of constancy and rash|ness of the vow, for better for worse, finds a just judgement in the conversation of Aches, Palseys and Catarrhs, which Wed-lock and Hymen hangs upon fools; who would have it thought con|stancy, to dote on Age and wrinkles, and pass their ignorance

Bridge, and I'll meet you with a Coach; then we may pretend we were out of Town when this hapned; we'l take <hi>Mathias</hi> with us and stop all mouths; come, pray be rul'd; here's six hundred Argu|ments in Gold of our side; we'l see the Escurial in our walk, and be merry a moneth upon the jest; and is not that better then spoil a good business with a little sneaking repentance?</p>

Puppey, blind wilful Puppey; dull, vain Ass, to believe she could fall in love with me at first sight; no, I am an Ass, 'tis vi|sible; she read the fool in my face, the <hi>Essex</hi> Calf; for what grace in|deed, beauty or vertue, can I plead, then this face which I can suffer because I am acquainted with it; dull Ass, to be flatter'd into a mischief when I was sober too! I could pull my self by my long ears, which, methinks, I see by star-light they are so visible, there is nothing to redeem such a folly, but a home, full revenge without mercy, upon the whole nest of them. What lights come there? I must hide my self some where, else the people in the street will pass their time with me.—More strokes of fortune yet! A <stage>
