Posteritie may pay your benefit the honor, &amp; thanks: when it shall know, that you dare, in these ●ig-giuen times, to countenance a legitimate Poeme. I must call it so, against all noise of opinion: from whose crude, and ayrie reports, I appeale, to that great and singular faculty of iudgement in your Lord|ship, able to vindicate truth from error. It is the first (of this race) that euer I dedicated to any person, and had I not thought it the best, it should haue beene taught a lesse ambition. Now, it approcheth your censure cheerefully, and with the same assurance, that innocency would appeare before a magistrate.</p>

                     <l>Keepe still your former face: and mixe againe</l>
                     <l>With these lost spirits. Runne all their mazes with 'hem:</l>
                     <l>For such are treasons. Find their windings out,</l>
                     <l>And subtle turnings, watch their snaky wayes,</l>
                     <l>Through brakes, and hedges, into woods of darkenesse,</l>
                     <l>Where they are faine to creepe vpon their brests</l>
                     <l>In paths ne're trod by men, but wolues, and panthers.</l>
                     <l>Learne, beside CATILINE, LENTVLVS, and those,</l>
                     <l>Whose names I haue; what new ones they draw in;</l>
                     <l>Who else are likely; what those great ones are,</l>

                     <l>And whither their hopes point: to warre, or ruine,</l>
                     <l>By some surprize. Explore all their intents,</l>
                     <l>And what you finde may profit the republique,</l>
                     <l>Acquaint me with it, either, by your selfe,</l>

                     <l>Is equall, and the same. But they, that are</l>

                     <l>For what with others is call'd anger, there,</l>
                     <l>Is crueltie, and pride. I know SYLLANVS,</l>

                     <l>A louer of the state, and one that would not,</l>

                     <l>Nor doe I thinke his sentence cruell (for</l>

                     <l>But that it is abhorring from our state;</l>
