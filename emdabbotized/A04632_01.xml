                  <p>_THere are, no doubt, a superci|lious race in the world, who will esteeme all office, done you in this kind, an iniurie; so solemne a vice it is with them to vse the authoritie of their ignorance, to the crying downe of <hi>Poetry,</hi> or the Professors: But, my gratitude must not leaue to correct their error; since I am none of those, that can suffer the benefits confer'd vpon my youth, to perish with my age. It is a fraile memorie, that remembers but present things: And, had the fauour of the times so conspir'd with my disposition, as it could haue brought forth other, or better, you had had the same proportion, &amp; number of the fruits, the first. Now, I pray you, to accept this, such, wherein neither the confession of my manners shall make you blush; nor of my studies, repent you to haue beene the instructer: And, for the profession of my thanke-fulnesse, I am sure, it will, with good men, find either praise, or excuse.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="15"/>
and gentleman-like! Yet, he condemn'd, and cry'd it downe, for the most pyed, and ridiculous that euer he saw.</p>

                        <p>Hang him, rooke, he! why, he has no more iudgement then a malt-horse. By S. GEORGE, I wonder youl'd loose a thought vpon such an animal: the most peremptory absurd clowne of <hi>christendome,</hi> this day, he is holden. I protest to you, as I am a gentleman, and a souldier, I ne're chang'd wordes, with his like. By his discourse, he should eate no|thing but hay. He was borne for the manger, pannier, or pack-saddle! He ha's not so much as a good phrase in his belly, but all old iron, and rustie prouerbes! a good commoditie for some smith, to make hob-nailes of.</p>

Come, put on your cloke, and wee'll goe to some priuate place, where you are acquainted, some tauerne, or so—and haue a bit— Ile send for one of these Fencers, and hee shall breath you, by my direction; and, then, I will teach you your tricke. You shall kill him with it, at the first, if you please. Why, I will learne you, by the true iudgement of the eye, hand, and foot, to controll any e|nemies point i' the world. Should your aduersarie confront you with a pistoll, 'twere nothing, by this hand, you should, by the same rule, controll his bullet, in a line: except it were hayle-shot, and spred.

Per|haps wee shall meet the CORIDON, his brother, there: and put him to the question.</p>

                        <l>My brother WELL-BRED, sir, (I know not how)</l>

                        <l>And (what was chiefe) it shew'd not borrowed in him,</l>
                        <l>But all he did, became him as his owne,</l>
                        <l>And seem'd as perfect, proper, and possest</l>
                        <l>As breath, with life, or colour, with the bloud.</l>
                        <l>But, now, his course is so irregular,</l>
                        <l>So loose, affected, and depriu'd of grace,</l>
                        <l>And he himselfe withall so farre falne off</l>
                        <l>From that first place, as scarse no note remaines,</l>

Well, hee is resolu'd to proue my honestie; faith, and I am resolu'd to proue his patience: oh I shall abuse him intollerably. This small piece of seruice, will bring him cleane out of loue with the souldier, for euer. He will neuer come within the signe of it, the sight of a cassock, or a musket-rest againe. Hee will hate the musters at Mile-end for it, to his dying day. It's no matter, let the world thinke me a bad coun|terfeit, If I cannot giue him the slip, at an instant: why, this is better then to haue staid his iourney! well, Ile follow him: oh, how I long to bee imployed.</p>

S'lid, I ha'much adoe, to feed my selfe; especially, on these leane rascally dayes, too; and't had beene any other day, but a fasting day (a plague on them all for mee) by this light, one might haue done the common-wealth good seruice, and haue drown'd them all i' the floud, two or three hundred thousand yeeres agoe. O, I doe stomack them hugely! I haue a maw now, and't were for S^r BEVIS his horse, against 'hem.</p>

                        <p>Mary that, which will make any man out of loue with 'hem, I thinke: their bad conditions, and you will needs know. First, they are of a <hi>Flemmish</hi> breed, I am sure on't, for they rauen vp more butter, then all the dayes of the weeke, beside; next, they stinke of fish, and leeke-por|ridge miserably: thirdly, they'le keepe a man deuoutly hungrie, all day, and at night send him supperlesse to bed.</p>

I haue been in the <hi>Indies</hi> (where this herb growes) where neither my selfe, nor a dozen gentlemen more (of my knowledge) haue receiued the tast of any other nutriment, in the world, for the space of one and twentie weekes, but the fume of this simple onely. Therefore, it cannot be, but 'tis most diuine! Further, take it in the nature, in the true kind so, it makes an <hi>antidote,</hi> that (had you taken the most deadly poyso|nous plant in all <hi>Italy,</hi> it should expell it, and clarifie you, with as much ease, as I speake. And, for your greene wound, your <hi>Balsamum,</hi> and your S^t. IOHN'S <hi>woort</hi> are all mere gulleries, and trash to it, especially your <hi>Trinidado</hi>: your <hi>Nicotian</hi> is good too. I could say what I know of the ver|tue of it, for the expulsion of rhewmes, raw humours, crudities, obstru|ctions, with a thousand of this kind, but I professe my selfe no <hi>quack-saluer.</hi> Only, thus much, by HERCVLES, I doe hold it, and will affirme it (be|fore any Prince in <hi>Europe</hi>) to be the most soueraigne, and precious weede, that euer the earth tendred to the vse of man.</p>

Re|uenge, vineger reuenge: vineger, and mustard reuenge: nay, and hee had not lyen in my house, 't would neuer haue grieu'd me, but being my guest, one, that Ile be sworne, my wife ha's lent him her smock off her back, while his one shirt ha's beene at washing; pawn'd her neckerchers for cleane bands for him; sold almost all my platters, to buy him <hi>tabacco</hi>; and he to turne monster of ingratitude, and strike his lawfull host! well, I hope to raise vp an host of furie for't: here comes Iustice CLEMENT.</p>

Sirrha, you, ballad-singer, and slops, your fellow there, get you out; get you home: or (by this steele) Ile cut off your eares, and that, presently.</p>

                        <p>Nay, for a more instance of their preposterous natures, but note, sir. They haue assaulted me some three, foure, fiue, sixe of them together, as I haue walkt alone, in diuers skirts i' the towne, as <hi>Turne-bull, White-chappell, Shore-ditch,</hi> which were then my quarters, and since vpon the <hi>Exchange,</hi> at my lodging, and at my ordinarie: where I haue driuen them afore me, the whole length of a street, in the open view of all our gallants, pittying to hurt them, beleeue me. Yet, all this lenitie will not ore-come their spleene: they will be doing with the pismier, raysing a hill, a man may spurne abroad, with his foot, at pleasure. By my selfe, I could haue slaine them all, but I delight not in murder. I am loth to beare any other then this bastinado for 'hem: yet, I hold it good politie, not to goe disarm'd, for though I bee skilfull, I may bee oppress'd with multitudes.</p>

                        <p>Indeed, that might be some losse; but, who respects it? I will tell you, sir, by the way of priuate, and vnder seale; I am a gentleman, and liue here obscure, and to my selfe: but, were I knowne to her Maiestie, and the Lords (obserue mee) I would vnder-take (vpon this poore head, and life) for the publique benefit of the state, not only to spare the intire lines of her subiects in generall, but to saue the one halfe, nay, three parts of her yeerely charge, in holding warre, and against what enemie soeuer.

                        <p>Why thus, sir. I would select nineteene, more, to my selfe, throughout the land; gentlemen they should bee of good spirit, strong, and able constitution, i would choose them by an instinct, a character, that I haue: and I would teach these nineteene, the speciall rules, as your <hi>Punto,</hi> your <hi>Reuerso,</hi> your <hi>Stoccata,</hi> your <hi>Imbroccata,</hi> your <hi>Passada,</hi> your <hi>Montanto</hi>: till they could all play very neare, or altogether as well as my selfe. This done, say the enemie were fortie thousand strong, we twentie would come into the field, the tenth of <hi>March,</hi> or thereabouts; and wee would chal|lenge twentie of the enemie; they could not, in their honour, refuse vs, well, wee would kill them: challenge twentie more, kill them; twentie more, kill them; twentie more, kill them too; and thus, would wee kill, euery man, his twentie a day, that's twentie score; twentie score, that's two hundreth; two hundreth a day, fiue dayes a thousand; fortie thou|sand; fortie times fiue, fiue times fortie, two hundreth dayes kills them all vp, by computation. And this, will I venture my poore gentleman-like carcasse, to performe (prouided, there bee no treason practis'd vpon vs) by faire, and discreet manhood, that is, ciuilly by the sword.</p>

You looke vpon me! though, I liue i' the citie here, amongst you, I will doe more reuerence, to him, when I meet him, then I will to the Major, out of his yeere. But, these paper-pedlers! these inke-dablers! They cannot expect reprehension, or reproch. They haue it with the fact.</p>

Here's a third, because, we tender your safetie, shall watch you, he is prouided for the purpose. Looke to your change, sir.</p>
