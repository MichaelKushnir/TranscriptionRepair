OF SENECA, ENGLISHED
The yeare of our Lord

               <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORA|BLE,
MAISTER DOCTOR
WOTTON: ONE OF THE
Queenes Maieſties priuy Coun|ſayle:
Alexander Neuyle wiſh|eth
Helth, vvith encreaſe of
Honor.</head>
               <p>_THis ſixtenth yeare of myne age (righte
honorable) reneweth a gratefull memo|ry
of your great goodnes towardes mee:
(for at Baptiſme your honor vouchſafed
to aunſweare for mee): and cauſeth mee
thus boldly to preſent theſe greene and
vnmelowed fruicts of my firſt truailes vnto you: as ſignes
and teſtimonies of a well diſpoſed minde vnto your honor.
Albeit when firſt I vndertoke the tranſlation of this pre|ſent
Tragoedy, I minded nothing leſſe, than that at any
tyme thus rudely transformed it shoulde come into the
<pb n="76" facs="82"/>
Printers hands. For I to none other ende remoued him,
from his naturall and lofty ſtyle, to our corrupt and baſe,
or as ſome men (but vntruly) affyrme it, moſt barbarous
Language: but onely to ſatiſfy the inſtant requeſts of a
few my familiar frends, who thought to haue put it to the
very ſame vſe, that SENECA himſelfe in his Inuen|tion
pretended: VVhich was by the tragicall and Pom|pous
ſhowe vpon Stage, to admoniſh all men of their fic|kle
Eſtates, to declare the vnconstant head of wauering
Fortune, her ſodayne interchaunged and ſoone altered
Face: and lyuely to expreſſe the iust reuenge, and feare|full
punishmēts of horrible Crimes, wherewith the wret|ched
worlde in theſe our myſerable dayes pyteouſly ſwar|meth.
This cauſed me not to be preciſe in following the Au|thor,
word for word: but ſometymes by addition, ſomtimes
by ſubtraction, to vſe the apteſt Phraſes in geuing the Sēſe
that I could inuent. VVhereat a great numbre (I know)
will be more offended than Reaſon or VVyſedome woulde
they should bee. Thus as I framed it to one purpoſe:
ſo haue my frends (to whom I can not well deny any thyng
that Frendshyps ryght may ſeeme iustly to requyre) wre|ſted
it to another effect: and by this meanes blowen it a|broade,
by ouerrash and vnaduiſed printing. By whych
fond deede I know vndoubtedly I shall receyue the poyſo|ned
infamies, of a number of venemous tonges, VVhere|fore
(ryght honorable) as I geue theſe the first Fruicts of
my trauayle vnto you: declaring therein the great good|wyll
and duety that I owe vnto your Honor, for the no|ble
diſpoſition of your vertuous mynde: ſo am I driuen
humbly to require your ſtrong ayde, and aſſured defence a|gaynſt
<pb facs="83"/>
the ſclaunderous aſſaults of ſuch malicious mouths,
which obtayned: I ſhalbe the better encouraged agaynst
an other time, to bestow my trauaile in matters of farre
greater weighte and importaunce. In the meane ſeaſon
(deſiring your Honour to take theſe ſimple Attemptes of
myne in good part:) I leaue you to the tuitiō of the right
high and mighty God: VVho keepe you long in health, &amp;
graunt you many happy yeares: with encreaſe of Honor.</p>

               <head>❀THE PREFACE TO
the Reader.</head>
               <p>_BEHOLD HERE BEFORE THY
Face (good Reader) the moſt lamentable Tra|gedy
of that moſt Infortunate Prince <hi>O Edipus,</hi>
for thy profit rudely tranſlated. Wonder not
at the groſeneſſe of the Style: neyther yet
accounte the Inuentours Dylygence dyſ|graced
by the Tranſlators Neglygence: VVho thoughe
that he hath ſomtimes boldly preſumed to erre from his Au|thor,
rouing at randon vvhere he liſt: adding and ſubtracting
at pleaſure: yet let not that engender diſdaynefull ſuſpition
vvith in thy learned breaſt. Marke thou rather vvhat is ment
by the vvhole courſe of the Hiſtory: and frame thy lyfe free
from ſuch miſchiefes, vvherevvith the World at this preſent
is vniuerſally ouervvhelmed, The vvrathfull vengeaunce of
God prouoked, the Body plagued, the mynde and Conſcience
in midſt of deepe deuouring daūgers moſt terribly aſſaulted.
<pb n="77" facs="83"/>
In ſuch ſort that I abhorre to write: and euen at the thought
thereof I tremble and quake for very inward griefe and feare
of minde: aſſuredly perſwading my ſelfe that the right high
and immortall God, will neuer leaue ſuch horrible and de|teſtable
crimes vnpuniſhed. As in this preſent Tragoedy, and
ſo forth in the proceſſe of the whole hyſtory, thou maiſt right
well perceyue. Wherein thou ſhalt ſee, a very expreſſe and
liuely Image of the incōſtant chaunge of fickle Fortune in the
perſon of a Prince of paſſing Fame and Renown, midſt whole
fluds of earthly bliſſe: by meare miſfortune (nay rather by the
deepe hidden ſecret Iudgemēts of God) piteouſly plunged in
moſt extreame miſeries. The whole Realme for his ſake in
ſtraungeſt guiſe greuouſly plagued: beſides the apparaunt de|ſtruction
of the Nobility: the generall death and ſpoyle of the
Cōminalty: the miſerable tranſformed Face of the City, with
an infinite number of miſchiefes more, which I paſſe ouer vn|reherſed.
Onely wiſh I all men by this Tragicall hyſtory (for
to that entent was it written) to beware of Synne: the ende
whereof is ſhamefull and miſerable. As in the moſt infortu|nate
fall of this vnhappy Prince right playnely appeareth.
Who by inward gripe of fearefull cōſuming Cōſcience wret|chedly
tormented: beholding the lamētable ſtate of his vile
infected Realmes, waſted by the burning rage of priuy ſpoy|ling
Peſtilence, finds himſelfe in tract of time, to be th'onely
plague &amp; miſery of the almoſt quight deſtroied City. Where|vpon
calling together his Prieſts and Prophets, &amp; aſking coū|ſaile
of the Gods by them, for preſent remedy in thoſe euils,
wherewith the Realme was than vniuerſally ouerflowen: aū|ſwere
was made that the Plague ſhould neuer ceaſſe, till king
<hi>LAIVS</hi> death were throughly reuenged: and the bloudy
Murtherer driuen into perpetuall exile. Which aunſwere re|ceiued,
<hi>OEDIPVS,</hi> farre more curious in bowlting out the
truth, than carefull of his own Eſtate: ſodainly ſlides into an
innumerable company of dredfull miſeries. For as ſoone as he
had once the perfect vewe of his own deteſtable deedes, and
wicked miſdemeanour caſt before his eyes, together with the
<pb facs="84"/>
vnnaturall killing of his Father <hi>LAIVS,</hi> the inceſtuous Ma|riage
of his Mother <hi>IOCASTA,</hi> the prepoſterous order of
his ill miſguyded lyfe, vvith a hundred moe like miſchiefes,
vvhich chaſte &amp; vndefiled eares abhorre to heare: fretting Fu|ry
cōmon enemy &amp; tormētor to corrupted cōſciēces pricking
him forvvard, all inflamed vvith Phrenſie and boyling in in|vvard
heate of vile infected minde, hee rooteth out his wret|ched
eyes vnnaturally, bereaueth his Mother her life (though
earneſtly requeſted thereto) beaſtly, &amp; in the ende in moſt ba|ſeſt
kind of ſlauery, baniſht, dieth miſerably. Leauing behind
him vnto all poſterities, a dredfull Example of Gods horrible
vengeaunce for ſinne. Such like terrors as theſe requireth this
our preſent Age, wherein Vice hath chiefeſt place, &amp; Vertue
put to flight, lies as an abiect, languiſhing in great extremity.
For the vvhich cauſe, ſo much the rather haue I ſuffred this
my baſe trāſlated Tragoedy to be publiſhed: frō his Author in
word &amp; verſe ſomewhat trāſformed, though in Senſe litle al|tered:
and yet oftentimes rudely encreaſed vvith mine owne
ſimple inuention: more raſhly (I cōfeſſe) than wiſely, vviſhing
to pleaſe all: to offend none. But vvhereas no man liues ſo
vprightly, vvhom ſlaundring tonges leaue vndiffamed, I re|ferre
my ſelfe to the Iudgement of the vviſeſt, litle eſteeming
the preiudiciall mouthes of ſuch carping Marchaūts, vvhych
ſuffer no mens doings almoſt to ſcape vndefiled. In fine, I be|ſeech
all to gether (if ſo it might be) to beare vvith my rude|nes,
&amp; conſider the groſenes of our owne Countrey language,
which cā by no meanes aſpire to the high lofty Latiniſts ſtile.
Myne onely entent vvas to exhorte men to embrace Vertue
and ſhun Vyce, according to that of the right famous &amp; ex|cellent
Poet <hi>Virgil</hi>
               </p>
               <quote>Diſcite inſticiam moniti, &amp; non temnere diuos.</quote>
               <p>This obtayned: I hold my ſelfe throughly cōtented: In the
meane ſeaſon I ende: wiſhing all men to ſhun Sin, the plaine
(but moſt perilous) pathway to perfect infelicity.</p>
