                  <hi>_CIrce</hi> by her alurements inamo|red
a young Gent. on her per|son,
who a while lived with
her in all sensuall delights vntill
vpon some iealosie conceived,
shee gaue him to drinke of an
inchanted Cup, and touching him with her gol|den
wand transformd him into a <hi>Lyon.</hi> After
some time shee remembring her former loue, re|transformed
him into his former shape. Which
he reasuming tooke the first occasion by flight to
quitt the place and comming into the presence of
his Maiestie, whose sight frees him from all feare
he relates the story of his fortune.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Circe</hi> had notice of her Lovers escape it,
<pb facs="3"/>
put her into a furious anger and then into a la|mentation
or loue passion. But being consolated
by her Nymphes; shee commands that all such
delights be prepared as may sweeten her sorow:
and presently all the voluntary beasts vnder her
subiection are introduced to make her sport.
After which the way being first prepared by <hi>Har|mony,</hi>
and the Influences; divine <hi>Beautie</hi> accom|panied
with foureteene stars of a happy constella|tion,
descends to the Musicke of the <hi>Spheares</hi> and
ioyneth with heroicke <hi>vertue,</hi> where in presence
of <hi>loue</hi> &amp; <hi>Cupid, Circe</hi> knowing the designe of the
destinies on this <unclear>glorious</unclear> Enterview, voluntarily
delivers her golden rod to <hi>MINERVA.</hi> So all
the inchantments being dissolued. <hi>TEMPE</hi>
which for a time had beene possest by the volun|tary
beasts of <hi>CIRCES</hi> Court; is restored to
the true followers of the <hi>MVSES.</hi>

               <head>The description of the Sceane.</head>
               <p>IN the vpper part of the border serving for or|nament
to the <hi>SCENE,</hi> was painted a faire
compartment of scrowles and quadratures, in
which was written <hi>TEMPE RESTAVRA|TVM.</hi>
On each side of this, lay a figure bigger
then the life, the one a woman with wings on
her head like <hi>MERCVRIE</hi> and a pen in her
hand: the other a man looking downe in a
<pb n="3" facs="3"/>
booke lying open before him, and a torch lighted
in his hand: that figur'd Invention; this Know|ledge.
Neere to these were children holding oug|ly
Maskes before their faces in action as if they
would afright them; others riding on tame beasts
and some blowing such wrethen Trumps as
m‚óèke confused noyse, in the corners sat other
Children hardning of darts in Lamps. But In|vention
&amp; Knowledge seeme not to be diverted
from their study by these childish bugbears. In
the midst of the two sides of this border in short
neeces sat two ougly figures, the one a woman
with a forked tongue, and snaky lockes, and
the vnder part of a Satyre, this Hagge held in her
hand a smiling vizard crown'd with Roses, and
was figured for Envie, vnder the Maske of friend|ship.
On the other side was sitting as horrid a
man Satyre with a wreath of poppy on his head,
and a Frog sitting on the fore part thereof; and a|boue
a Batt flying, this represented curions <hi>Igno|rance.</hi>
The rest of the Border was fild vp with
severall fancies, which lest I should be too long
in the description of the frame, I will goe to the
picture it selfe, and indeed these showes are no|thing
else but pictures with Light and Motion.</p>
               <p>A Curtaine being drawne vp, the Lightsome
<hi>Scene</hi> appear'd, shewing a delicious place by na|ture
and art; where in a Valley inviron'd with
<pb n="4" facs="4"/>
Hils a farre off was seated, a prospect of curious
Arbours of various formes. The first order of
marble Pillasters. Betweene which were neeces
of rocke worke and Statues; some spurting
water received into vazes beneath them, and o|thers
standing on Pedestals. On the returnes of
these Pillasters run slender Cornishments. From
which was raised a second order of gratious
termes with womens faces which beare vp the
ornaments. Vnder this to a leaning height was
a Ballestrata inricht. All this second story seem'd
of silver worke mixt with fresh Verdures which
on the tops of these arbours covered some of the
returnes, in the forme of tipes with tender bran|ches
dangling downe: others were cover'd flatt
and had flower pots of gold for finishing: be|hind
these appear'd the tops of slender trees,
whose leaues seem'de to moue with a gentle
breath comming from the farre off Hills.</p>
               <p>Out of this pleasant place comes in hast, a yong
Gentleman, looking often backe, as if he feared
a pursuit; and beeing come into the midst of the
roome, looking still distractedly about him, hee
wipes his face with an handkercher, and then ad|vanceth
towards the State, and speakes.</p>

a farre off a Landscipt and a calme Sea which
did terminate the Horizon; in the hither part

two other Clouds descending, &amp; in them
were discovered eight Stars; these being come to

Stars to the number of sixe: and aboue all in
a Chariot of gold-smithes workes richly adorned
with precious lemmes, sat divine Beauty, over

returning vp againe, and the other still descending
