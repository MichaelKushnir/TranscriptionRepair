               <p>_A Citizen of Athens dwelling at Su|nium a port-towne of Attica hauing two children, <hi>Chremes</hi> a Sonne, and <hi>Pamphila</hi> a daughter, had his daughter ſtolne away by Pyrats when ſhe was of ſuch tender age that ſhe could onely tell her owne and parents names. After this the Athe|nian died. The Pyrats ſold the child to a Mer|chant of Rhodes, who gaue her to a Strumpet which he loued. This Harlot had a daughter called <hi>Thais,</hi> ſomewhat elder then <hi>Pamphila:</hi> Which children ſhe ſo brought vp together, that all men of Rhodes did repute them for Siſters. <hi>Thais</hi> in proceſſe of time tooke to her mothers trade of life; and yeel|ding vp her ſelfe to a ſtrangers deuotion, was by him caried to Athens; where he dying left her good means. He thus dead, ſhe was taken vp by one <hi>Thraſo</hi> aſouldier: he alſo hauing a while accompanied her, had occaſion of trauaile into Caria. Meane while
<pb n="51" facs="36"/>the mother of <hi>Thais</hi> died at Rhodes: Her goods fell to a brother, who (with them) expoſed to ſale the abouenamed <hi>Pamphila,</hi> iust vpon the time where|in the ſoldier paſſed that way. Her youth and beau|tie induced the ſouldier (ignorant of all paſſages) to buy her, as a fit gift to beſtow on <hi>Thais</hi> at his re|turne to Athens. But ſhe before that time (whores do not liue in expectation, nor vpon the meanes of one man onely) had intertaind the loue of one <hi>Phaedria</hi> a young gentleman, ſonne of an ancient Athenian Citizen. She alſo had by this time gained ſome inkling of the parentage of <hi>Pamphila,</hi> and that one <hi>Chremes</hi> a genteleman of Athens was in good likelihood uaturall brother to the maiden: for better diſcouery whereof, ſhe had had conference with him (a loofe off) touching the matter. The ſouldier returnes to Athens bringing <hi>Pamphila</hi> along with him, (her maiden-head is queſtiond by <hi>Terence, Act. 1. Sen. 2.</hi> in theſe words <hi>etiamne amplius?</hi> To auoid matter vnfitting for the grace of the Comedie, but ſhe was (beyond any contrarie ſuppoſable coniecture) a maiden: for a child might ſillip this ſouldier out of his courage; and foolerie was all the allurement he could vſe to her) and be|ing thus returned, he finds <hi>Phaedria</hi> entred into <hi>Thais</hi> her bookes: out of which if he be not cleane wiped, <hi>Pamphila</hi> is not for her, as the ſouldier affir|meth. <hi>Terence</hi> hath ſet out this <hi>Thais</hi> as none of the
<pb n="52" facs="37"/>worſt of that courſe of life; and withall of good diſcretion in her cariage. A <hi>Dilemma</hi> is now put vpon her; loue and conſideration are the two hornes: ſhe muſt venture the goring by one of them. Loue pleades firſt, and this is naturall to her bloud; and <hi>Phaedria</hi> beſides deſerues it. I but hee may be ten|dered a wife; his appetite cloyd his father workeher diſpleaſure. Reſolute loue in ſpite of theſe premiſſes hath downe the cō●luſion On the other ſide a reputed ſiſter, that ſiſter hath good friends, thoſe friends able to ſtrengthen her vnſetled fortunes; if by her meanes the one be reſtored to the other: Thus pleades Conſideration. Wiſely therefore ſhe keepes the middle way for barring <hi>Phaedria</hi> her company for abrace of dayes (telling him why) ſhe aimes to gull the ſouldier of the wench by this courteſie; and then to recall <hi>Phaedria</hi> to his former contentment. <hi>Phaedria</hi> aſſents, leaues the Citie. giues withall charge to <hi>Parmeno</hi> his fathers man, for bringing an <hi>Eunuch</hi> to <hi>Thais</hi> in his abſence: <hi>Phaedria</hi> gone, <hi>Thraſo</hi> alſo ſends <hi>Pamphila</hi> to her by <hi>Gnato</hi> a Pa|raſite. In the paſſing of the maiden thither, <hi>Chaerea</hi> a younger brother of <hi>Phaedria</hi> ſpies her, falles in loue with her, dogges her, by accident looſeth her, chafes with himſelf at it: then to <hi>Parmeno</hi> comming vpon him, diſcouers his mind and whereto caried. <hi>Parmeno</hi> informes him of an <hi>Eunuch</hi> by his brother <hi>Phaedria</hi> ſent, and by him forthwith to be conueied
<pb n="53" facs="37"/>to the very houſe where the maid abideth. So that by ſhifting cloathes with the <hi>Eunuch</hi> he may vn|diſcouered be brought to her; the <hi>Eunuch</hi> nor hee having euer before beene ſeene by <hi>Thais</hi> or any of her family <hi>Chaerea</hi> followes the aduiſe, is brought thither, rauiſheth the maiden. Much coyle hence ariſeth, <hi>Pamphila</hi> at length being found to bee free|borne, <hi>Chaerea</hi> marries her; <hi>Thais</hi> is taken into pro|tection by the father of the two brothers. The Souldier for mirth and coſt ſparing is admit|ted among them, by <hi>Gnatoes</hi> perſwa|ſion, with the conſent of <hi>Phaedria.</hi>
