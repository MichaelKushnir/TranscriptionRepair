So short-liu'd are the <hi>bodies</hi> of all things, in comparison of their <hi>soules.</hi> And, though <hi>bodies</hi> oft-times haue the ill luck to be sensually preferr'd, they find af|terwards, the good fortune (when <hi>soules</hi> liue) to be vtterly forgotten. This it is hath made the most royall <hi>Princes,</hi> and greatest <hi>persons</hi> (who are commonly the <hi>personaters</hi> of these <hi>actions</hi>) not onely studious of riches, and magnificence in the outward celebration, or shew; (which rightly be|comes them) but curious after the most high, and heartie <hi>inuentions,</hi> to furnish the inward parts: (and those grounded vpon <hi>antiquitie,</hi> and solide <hi>learnings</hi>) which, though their <hi>voyce</hi> be taught to sound to present occasi|ons, their <hi>sense,</hi> or doth, or should alwayes lay hold on more remou'd <hi>my|steries.</hi> And, howsoeuer some may squemishly crie out, that all endeuour of <hi>learning,</hi> and <hi>sharpnesse</hi> in these transitorie <hi>deuices</hi> especially, where it steps beyond their little, or (let me not wrong 'hem) no braine at all is su|per●luous; I am contented, these fastidious <hi>stomachs</hi> should leaue my full tables, and enioy at home, their cleane emptie trenchers, fittest for such ayrie tasts: where perhaps a few <hi>Italian</hi> herbs, pick'd vp, and made into a <hi>sallade,</hi> may find sweeter acceptance, than all, the most nourishing, and sound meates of the world.</p>

                  <p>Yet, that I may not vtterly defraud the <hi>Reader</hi> of his hope, I am drawne to giue it those briefe touches, which may leaue behind some shadow of what it was: And first of the <hi>Attyres.</hi>

                  <p>That, of the Lords, had part of it (for the fashion) taken from the <hi>an|tique Greeke</hi> statue; mixed with some <hi>moderne</hi> additions: which made it both gracefull, and strange. On their heads they wore <hi>Persick</hi> crownes, that were with scroles of <hi>gold-plate</hi> turn'd outward, and wreath'd about with a <hi>carnation</hi> and <hi>siluer</hi> net-lawne; the one end of which hung carelesly on the left shoulder; the other was trick'd vp before, in seuerall degrees of foulds, betweene the plates, and set with rich iewels, and great pearle. Their bodies were of <hi>carnation</hi> cloth of siluer, richly wrought, and cut to expresse the <hi>naked,</hi> in manner of the <hi>Greeke Thorax</hi>; girt vnder the brests with a broad <hi>belt</hi> of cloth of gold, imbrodered, and fastened before with iewels: Their Labels were of <hi>white</hi> cloth of siluer, lac'd, and wrought curiously betweene, sutable to the vpper halfe of their sleeues; whose nether parts, with their bases, were of <hi>watchet</hi> cloth of siluer, chev'rond all ouer with lace. Their Mantills were of seuerall colour'd silkes, distinguishing their qualities, as they were coupled in payres; the first, <hi>skie colour</hi>▪ the second, <hi>pearle colour</hi>; the third, <hi>flame colour</hi>; the fourth, <hi>tawnie:</hi> and these cut in leaues, which were subtilly tack'd vp, and imbrodered with <hi>Oe's,</hi> and be|tweene euerie ranke of leaues, a broad siluer lace. They were fastened on the right shoulder, and fell compasse downe the back in gracious folds, and were againe tyed with a round knot, to the fastning of their swords. Vpon their legges they wore <hi>siluer</hi> Greaues, answering in worke to their Labells; and these were their <hi>accoutrements.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Ladies <hi>attyre</hi> was wholly new, for the inuention, and full of glorie; as hauing in it the most true impression of a <hi>celestiall</hi> figure: the vpper part of <hi>white</hi> cloth of siluer, wrought with IVNOES <hi>birds</hi> and <hi>fruits</hi>; a loose vnder-garment, full gather'd, of <hi>carnation,</hi> strip't with <hi>siluer,</hi> and parted with a golden <hi>Zone:</hi> beneath that, another flowing garment, of <hi>watchet</hi> cloth of siluer, lac'd with gold; through all which, though they were round, and swelling, there yet appeared some touch of their delicate <hi>lineaments,</hi> pre|seruing the sweetnesse of <hi>proportion,</hi> and expressing it selfe beyond expres|sion. The <hi>attyre</hi> of their heads did answer, if not exceed; their haire being carelesly (but yet with more art, then if more affected) bound vnder the circle of a rare and rich <hi>Coronet,</hi> adorn'd with all varietie, and choise of iewels; from the top of which, flow'd a transparent <hi>veile,</hi> downe to the ground; whose verge, returning vp, was fastened to either side in most sprightly manner. Their shooes were <hi>Azure,</hi> and gold, set with Rubies and Diamonds; so were all their garments; and euerie part abounding in or|nament.</p>
                  <p>No lesse to be admir'd, for the grace, and greatnesse, was the whole <hi>Machine</hi> of the <hi>Spectacle,</hi> from whence they came: the first part of which
<pb n="927" facs="492"/>
was a MIKPOKOΣMOΣ, or <hi>Globe,</hi> fill'd with <hi>Countreys,</hi> and those gilded; where the <hi>Sea</hi> was exprest, heightned with siluer waues. This stood, or rather hung (for no <hi>Axell</hi> was seene to support it) and turning softly, dis|couered the first <hi>Masque</hi> (as wee haue before, but too runningly declared) which was of the <hi>men,</hi> sitting in faire <hi>composition,</hi> within a <hi>mine</hi> of seuerall metalls: To which, the lights were so placed, as no one was seene; but seemed, as if onely REASON, with the splendor of her crowne, illumin'd the whole Grot.</p>
                  <p>On the sides of this (which began the other part) were placed two great <hi>Statues,</hi> fayned of gold, one of ATLAS, the other of HERCVLES, in varied postures, bearing vp the Clouds, which were of <hi>Releue,</hi> embossed, and tralucent, as Naturalls: To these, a cortine of painted clouds ioyned, which reach'd to the vpmost roofe of the Hall; and sodainely opening, reueal'd the three <hi>Regions</hi> of <hi>Ayre:</hi> In the highest of which, sate IVNO, in a glorious throne of gold, circled with <hi>Comets,</hi> and fierie <hi>Meteors,</hi> engen|dred in that hot and drie <hi>Region</hi>; her feet reaching to the lowest: where, was made a <hi>Rainebow,</hi> and within it, <hi>Musicians</hi> seated, figuring <hi>airie</hi> spirits, their habits various, and resembling the seuerall colours, caused in that part of the <hi>aire</hi> by reflexion. The midst was all of darke and condensed clouds, as being the proper place, where <hi>Raine, Haile,</hi> and other watrie <hi>Me|teors</hi> are made; out of which, two concaue clouds, from the rest, thrust forth themselues (in nature of those <hi>Nimbi,</hi> wherein, by <hi>Homer, Virgil,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>gods</hi> are fain'd to descend) and these carried the eight <hi>Ladies,</hi> ouer the heads of the two <note n="a" place="marg" anchored="true">
                        <hi>Atlas,</hi> and <hi>Hercules,</hi> the Figures men|tioned before.</note>
                     <hi>Termes</hi>; who (as the engine mou'd) seem'd also to bow themselues (by vertue of their shadowes) and discharge their shoulders of their glorious burden: when, hauing set them on the earth, both they and the clouds gathered themselues vp againe, with some rapture of the <hi>be|holders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that, which (as aboue in place, so in the beautie) was most taking in the <hi>Spectacle,</hi> was the <hi>sphere</hi> of <hi>fire,</hi> in the top of all, encompassing the <hi>ayre,</hi> and imitated with such art and industrie, as the <hi>spectators</hi> might discerne the Motion (all the time the <hi>Shewes</hi> lasted) without any Moouer; and that so swift, as no eye could distinguish any colour of the light, but might forme to it selfe fiue hundred seuerall hiewes, out of the tralucent bodie of the <hi>ayre,</hi> obiected betwixt it, and them.</p>
                  <p>And this was crown'd with a statue of IVPITER, the <hi>Thunderer.</hi>

                  <p>_THe worthy custome of honouring worthy <hi>marriages,</hi> with these noble <hi>solemnities,</hi> hath, of late yeeres, aduanc'd it selfe frequently with vs; to the reputation no lesse of our <hi>court,</hi> then <hi>nobles:</hi> expressing besides (through the difficulties of expence, and trauell, with the cheerefulnesse of vnder-taking) a most reall affection in the <hi>personators,</hi> to those, for whose sake they would sustayne these <hi>per|sons.</hi> It behoues then vs, that are trusted with a part of their honor, in these <hi>celebrati|ons,</hi> to doc nothing in them, beneath the dignitie of either. With this pre|posed part of iudgement, I aduenture to giue that abroad, which in my first conception I intended honorably fit: and (though it hath labour'd since, vnder censure) I, that know <hi>Truth</hi> to be alwayes of one stature, and so like a rule, as who bends it the least way, must needes doe an iniurie to the right, cannot but smile at their tyrannous ignorance, that will offer to slight me (in these things being an <hi>artificer</hi>) and giue themselues a peremp|toric licence to iudge, who haue neuer touch'd so much as to the barke, or vtter shell of any <hi>knowledge.</hi> But, their daring dwell, with them. They haue found a place, to powre out their follies, and I a seate, to sleepe out the passage.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>scene</hi> to this <hi>Masque,</hi> was a high, steepe, red cliffe, aduancing it selfe into the cloudes, figuring the place, from whence (as I haue beene, not fa|bulously, informed) the honourable family of the RADCLIFFES first tooke their name <hi>(à cliuo rubro)</hi> and is to be written with that <hi>Orthography</hi>; as I haue obseru'd out of M. CAMBDEN, in his mention of the <hi>Earles</hi> of <hi>Sussex.</hi> This cliffe was also a note of <hi>height, greatnesse,</hi> and <hi>antiquitie</hi>; before which, on the two sides, were erected two <hi>pilasters,</hi> chardg'd with spoiles and <hi>trophees,</hi> of <hi>loue,</hi> and his <hi>mother,</hi> consecrate to <hi>marriage</hi>: amongst which were old and yong persons figur'd, bound with <hi>roses,</hi> the wedding gar|ments,

rocks, and spindles, hearts transfixt with arrowes, others flaming, <hi>virgins</hi> girdles, gyrlonds, and worlds of such like; all wrought round and bold: and ouer-head two personages, <hi>triumph</hi> and <hi>victorie,</hi> in flying po|stures, and twise so big as the life, in place of the arch, and holding a gyr|lond of <hi>myrtle</hi> for the key. All which, with the <hi>pillars,</hi> seem'd to be of burnished gold, and emboss'd out of the mettall. Beyond the cliffe was seene nothing but cloudes, thick, and obscure; till on the sodaine, with a solemne musique, a bright skie breaking forth; there were discouered, first two <note n="*" place="marg" anchored="true">Both <hi>doues,</hi> and <hi>swannes</hi> were sacred to this <hi>goddesse,</hi> and as well with the one as the other, her chariot in induc'd by <hi>O|uid. l.</hi> 10. and 11. <hi>Metamor.</hi>

I am their Crude, and their Sublimate; their Praecipitate, and their vnctuous; their male and their female; Sometimes their <hi>Hermaphro|dite</hi>; what they list to stile me. It is I, that am corroded, and exalted, and sublim'd, and reduc'd, and fetch'd ouer, and filtred, and wash'd, and wip'd; what betweene their salts and their sulphures; their oyles, and their tar|tars, their brines and their vinegers, you might take me out now a sous'd <hi>Mercury,</hi> now a salted <hi>Mercury,</hi> now a smoak'd and dri'd <hi>Mercury,</hi> now a pouldred and pickl'd <hi>Mercury:</hi> neuer Herring, Oyster, or Coucumer past so many vexations: my whole life with 'hem hath bene an exercise of tor|ture; one, two, three, foure and fiue times an houre ha'they made mee dance the <hi>Philosphicall</hi> circle, like an Ape through a hoope, or a dogge in a wheele.

They will calcine you a graue matron (as it might bee a mother o' the maides) and spring vp a yong virgin, out of her ashes, as fresh as a <hi>Phoenix</hi>: Lay you an old Courtier o' the coales like a sausedge, or a bloat-herring, and after they ha' broil'd him enough, blow a soule into him with a paire of bel|lowes, till hee start vp into his galliard, that was made when <hi>Mounsieur</hi> was here. They professe familiarly to melt down all the old sinners o' the suburbes once in halfe a yeere, into fresh gamesters againe. Get all the crack'd maiden-heads, and cast'hem into new Ingots, halfe the wenches o' the towne are <hi>Alchymie.</hi> See, they begin to muster againe, and draw their forces out against me!

                        <p>IT is in vaine, <hi>Vulcan,</hi> to pitch your net in the sight of the fowle thus: I am no sleepy <hi>Mars,</hi> to be catch'd i'your subtile toyes.

Sir, would you beleeue, it should be come to that height of impudence, in mankind, that such a nest of fire|wormes, as these are (because their Patron <hi>Mulciber</hi> heretofore has made
<pb n="1007" facs="532"/>
stooles stirre, and statues dance, a dog of brasse to barke, and (which some will say, was his worst acte, a woman to speake) should therefore with their heats cal'd <hi>Balnei, cineris,</hi> or horse-doung, professe to outworke the <hi>Sunne</hi> in vertue, and contend to the great act of generation, nay, almost creation? it is so, though. For, in yonder vessels which you see, in their laboratorie, they haue inclos'd <hi>Materials,</hi> to produce men, beyond the deedes of <hi>Deucalion,</hi> or <hi>Prometheus</hi> (of which, one, they say, had the <hi>Philoso|phers</hi> stone, and threw it ouer his shoulder, the other the fire, and lost it.) And what men are they, they are so busie about, thinke you? not com|mon or ordinary creatures, but of rarity and excellence, such as the times wanted, and the <hi>Age</hi> had a speciall deale of neede of: such, as there was a necessitie, they should be artificiall; for <hi>Nature</hi> could neuer haue thought or dreamt o' their composition. I can remember some o' their titles to you, and the ingredients doe not looke for <hi>Paracelsus</hi> man among 'hem, that he promised you out of white bread, and dele-wine, for hee neuer came to light. But of these, let me see; the first that occurres; a master of the <hi>Duel,</hi> a carrier of the differencies. To him went spirit of ale, a good quantitie, with the amalgama of sugar and nutmegs, oyle of othes, sul|phure of quarrell, strong waters, valour precipitate, vapor'd o're the helme with tobacco, and the rosin of <hi>Mars</hi> with a dram o'the businesse, for that's the word of tincture, the businesse. Let me alone with the bu|sinesse, I will carrie the businesse. I doe vnderstand the businesse. I doe finde an affront i' the businesse. Then another is a fencer i' the <hi>Mathe|matiques,</hi> or the townes-cunning-man, a creature of arte too; a supposed secretary to the starres; but, indeed, a kind of lying <hi>Intelligencer</hi> from those parts. His materials, if I be not deceiu'd, were iuyce of almanacks, extra|ction of <hi>Ephemerides,</hi> scales of the <hi>Globe,</hi> fylings of figures, dust o'the twelue houses, conserue of questions, salt of confederacy, a pound of aduenture, a graine of skill, and a drop of trueth. I saw vegitals too, aswell as mine|rals, put into one glasse there, as adders tongue, title-bane, nitre of clyents, tartar of false conueyance, <hi>Aurum palpabile,</hi> with a huge deale of talke, to which they added tincture of conscience, with the faces of honesty; but for what this was, I could not learne; onely I haue ouer-heard one o' the <hi>Artists</hi> say, Out o'the corruption of a Lawyer was the best generation of a Broker in suits: whether this were he or no, I know not.</p>
