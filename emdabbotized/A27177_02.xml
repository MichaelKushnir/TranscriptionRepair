                        <l>To ſweare it, if you ſweare againſt, is war</l>
                        <l>To aſſure you any thing, unleſse you ſee,</l>
                        <l>And ſo conceive, is vanity in me;</l>
                        <l>Therefore I leave it to it ſelfe, and pray</l>
                        <l>Like a good Barke, it may worke out to day,</l>
                        <l>And ſtem all doubts; 'twas built for ſuch a proofe,</l>
                        <l>And we hope highly: if ſhe lye aloofe</l>

                        <l>And ſweet opinion'd, and we are bound to ſay,</l>
                        <l>You are worthy Judges, and you crowne the Play.</l>
