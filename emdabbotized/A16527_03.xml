                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>WHen <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, after all his Con|queſts (ſhining through the glory of innumera|ble victories) was returned backe to <hi>Babylon,</hi> where the Ambaſſadours of the whole worlde did attend his comming, as one that was deſti|nied to domineere ouer all: there being admired by the <hi>Grecians,</hi> adored by the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and as it were drun|ken with the delights of an extraordinary proſperitie, hee ſuffered himſelf to be tranſported with an inundation of pleaſure; till ſitting at one of his feaſts by the meanes of the ſonnes of <hi>Antipater</hi> his cup|bearers, in the beſt, both of his age and fortune, he was ſuddenly poi|ſoned.</p>
                  <p>Incontinent after his death, thoſe that were in great eſtimation with himſelfe during his life, and then with the armie, aſsembled themſelues together, neglecting for a long time his funeralls, whilſt buſied about the diſpoſing of his Empire: at laſt (after diuers o|pinions) it was concluded, that if <hi>Roxane,</hi> the widdow of their deceaſed ſoueraigne (who was then at the point to bee deliuered of her birth) happened to beare a ſonne, hee ſhould ſucceed in his fa|thers place, and till he were come to ſome maturitie of age, <hi>Perdic|cas, Leonatus, Craterus,</hi> and <hi>Antipater</hi> were appointed to bee his Tutors: But the foote-men in a diſdaine, that their aduice was not required, proclaimed <hi>Arideus, Alexanders</hi> baſlard brother
<pb facs="91"/>king, and gaue him a guard, of which <hi>Meleager</hi> procured him|ſelfe to be made Captaine. At this ſodaine alteration, the horſe|men being troubled, they following <hi>Perdiccas</hi> pitched their campe without the citie; yet in the end, this tumult being by the eloquence of <hi>Perdiccas</hi> appeaſed, all the captaines re-aſſembled themſelues, and hauing diuided the prouinces, made an agreement, which la|ſted not long: For ſuch was the vehement ambition of thoſe great men, that with all manner of hoſtilitie, they ſtudied how to vnder|mine one another, and firſt of all, <hi>Meleager</hi> after a pretended re|conciliation, (though hauing fled to a Temple for refuge) was ſlaine by the appointment of <hi>Perdiccas,</hi> who after aſpiring to a ſuperio|ritie ouer the reſt, whilſt he went to warre againſt <hi>Ptolomie</hi> in <hi>Ae|gypt,</hi> by a ſudden mutinie of his owne ſouldiers was miſerably murdered. Then the onely captaine of his faction that remained aliue, was <hi>Eumenes,</hi> a man ſingularly valorous, who encountering with <hi>Craterus</hi> and <hi>Neoptolemus,</hi> by the death of themſelues defeated their armie, whereby being highly aduanced, he was great|ly enuied▪ and (<hi>Leonatus</hi> hauing lately before dyed in a conflict betwixt him and the <hi>Athenians,</hi>) <hi>Antigonus</hi> in the name of the reſt was ſent againſt him with a great armie, betwixt whom there hauing paſſed diuers skirmiſhes with a variable ſucceſſe, and ſome priuate conference without agreement: In the end, he was betrayed by his owne ſouldiers, and deliuered bound to <hi>Antigonus,</hi> who ſhortly after cauſed him to be put to death.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Antigonus</hi> (his riuals in the authoritie being remoued out of his way) did aſpire to that himſelfe, from which he was ſent to ſeclude others, and hauing murdered diuers of the gouernors, hee diſpoſed of their Prouinces as hee pleaſed: whereof <hi>Caſſander, Ptolomie,</hi> and <hi>Liſimachus,</hi> aduertiſed by <hi>Seleucus,</hi> who fled for feare of incrring the like danger; they entred all together in a league againſt <hi>Antigonus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now at this time <hi>Olimpias</hi> plagued all the faction of <hi>Caſſan|der</hi>
                     <pb facs="91"/>in <hi>Macedonie,</hi> hauing cauſed <hi>Arideus</hi> and his Queene <hi>Eu|ridice</hi> to be put to death; by which, and other cruelties (hauing loſt the fauour of the people) ſhee was conſtrained, when <hi>Caſſander</hi> came againſt her, to retire herſelfe within a Towne; which (by rea|ſon of the ſcarcitie of victuals) not being able to defend, ſhee ren|dred, together with her ſelfe to <hi>Caſſander,</hi> by whom (notwith|ſtanding of his promiſe to the contrary) ſhe was publikely put to death, and ſo hauing proceeded ſo farre in wickednes, he thought it no time to retire till he had extinguiſhed all his maſters race; hee cauſed <hi>Roxane</hi> and her ſonne to bee murdered; and ſoone after, <hi>Hercules, Alexanders</hi> baſtard ſonne, which multitude of mur|ders, gaue to him the crowne of <hi>Macedone;</hi> and to me, the Subiect of this Politragicke Tragedie.</p>
