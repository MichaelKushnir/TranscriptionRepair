               <p>_LAIVS King of Thebes, hadde by his Wyfe and
Queene IOCASTA, a Sonne named OEDI|PVS:
Who being yet in his Mothers Wombe,
APOLLO his Oracle pronounced, that by the
handes of that childe, King LAIVS the father ſhould bee
murthered. The feare whereof cauſed the King to commaūd
him to be put to death. The Kinges heardman, who had the
charge to ſee this done, on thone ſide mooued with compaſſi|on
ouer a tender weakeling: and on the otherſide, afraid to in|curre
the King his maiſters diſpleaſure, contented himſelfe
onely to boare two hoales through the Infants two feete, and
with certayne plyable Twigges beinge thruſt through the
ſame, hong him vp on a tree by the Heeles: ſuppoſing that
heereby hee ſhould cōmit a leſſe crime in ſuffring the childe
to periſhe by famine, then in playing the Butcher himſefe. It
fortuned, that one PHORBAS heardman to POLYBI|VS
King of Corynth, paſſing by that way &amp; hearing a yong
Childe cyre, went and cut him downe, and caryinge him to
Corynth, it ſo fell out that at length hee was giuen for a pre|ſent
<pb facs="45"/>
or gyft to MEROPE, Wyfe to the ſaid King POLY|BVS.
This OEDIPVS afterward going to Thebes, in
a certayne ſedicious hurly burly in the countrey there, vna|wares
and vnwitting ſlewe King LAIVS his Father. About
which tyme the City of Thebes, and Countrey there about
was meruelouſly infeſted with a monſter called Sphinx: who
propounding a certaine Riddle, or obſcure queſtion to ſuch as
paſſed that vvay, and deuouringe as many, as coulde not
aſſoyle the ſame. To him that coulde aſſoile it and ſo rid
the Countrey from that ſo vgly and daūgerous a monſter, the
mariage of Queene IOCASTA, and the kingdome of The|bes
was promyſed as a recompence: OEDIPVS after ma|ny
others, taking the matter in hand, aſſoyled the Ryddle, &amp;
ſlew the mōſter. Whereupō marying the Queene, not know|ing
her to bee his owne Mother, had by her foure Chyldren:
ETHEOCLES, POLYNICES, ANTIGONE, &amp;
ISMENE. In the end, hauing knowledg, how firſt hee had
kylled his Father, and then inceſtuouſly maryed his Mother,
hee forſooke his kingdome being continually infeſted wyth
the plague, &amp; (as one aſhamed to loke any man in theface) pul|led
out his own Eyes, and hid himſelfe in corners and ſolitary
places. His Sonnes ETHEOCLES &amp; POLYNICES
agreed to raigne enterchaungeably, that is to wit, ETHE|OCLES,
one yeare, and POLYNICES the other. E|THEOCLES
hauing raigned his yeare, refuſed according
to the articles of agrement, to reſigne the Crowne to his bro|ther
for the next yeare. Whereupō they fel to mortal warres,
and in the end meaning by combat to ende the matter, they
mutually ſlew one the other. <hi>And note that this Tra|gedy,
was left by the Authour vnperfect, becauſe it ney|ther
hath in it, Chorus, ne yet the fifth Acte.</hi>

                  <l>To be a noble King indeede, that can ſupplant his foes,</l>
                  <l>And Subiectes cancred hate ſuppreſſe. A King is often ſtayed</l>
                  <l>From doyng many thinges he would, when Subiectes loue is wayed.</l>

He that will loue of Subiectes winne, with Elemency muſt raygne:</l>
                  <l>A King that's hated, cannot long in Kingly ſeate remayne.</l>
                  <l>For Kingdomes Kinges can beſt deſcribe, what preceptes needfull are.</l>

                  <l>Both Countrey, houſe, land, Wyfe, and Chyld, to compaſſe my deſyre.</l>
