your projects are put down, and you'l take up no new: but what ſhall be (ſpectators) to pleaſe you. And you Poetick part induces you, t'appologize now for the Poet too, as they ha' done already, you to the Ladies, you to the Cavaliers and Gentry; you to the City friend, and all for the Poet, Poet, Poet, when alls but begging tho. I'le ſpeak to 'em all, and to my Countrey folkes too if here be any o'em: and yet not beg for the Poet tho', why ſhould we? has not he money for his doings? and the beſt price too? becauſe we would ha' the beſt: And if it be not, why ſo? The Poet has ſhewd his wit and we our man|ners. But to ſtand beg, beg for reputation for one that has no countenance to carry it, and muſt ha' money is ſuch a Paſtime!—If it were for one of the great and curious Poets that give theſe Playes as the Prologue ſaid, and mo|ney too, to have 'em acted; For them, indeed, we are bound to ply for an applauſe. Becauſe they look for no|thing elſe, and ſcorn to beg for themſelves. But then you'l ſay thoſe Playes are not given to you; you pay as much for your ſeats at them as at theſe, though you ſit nere the merrier, nor riſe the wiſer, they are ſo above common underſtanding; and tho' you ſee for your love you will judge for your money, why ſo for that too, you may. But take heed you diſpleaſe not the Ladies tho' who are their partiall judges, being brib'd by flattering verſes to commend their Playes; for whoſe faire cauſe, and by their powerfull voyces to be cry'd up wits o' Court, the right worſhipfull Poets boaſt to have made thoſe enter|ludes, when for ought you know they bought 'em of Uni|verſitie Scholars tho', and onely ſhew their own wits in owning other mens; and that but as they are like neither. As thus, do you like that Song? yes▪ I made it. Is that Scene or that Jeſt good? Yes, Twas mine; and then if all be good 'twas all mine. There's wit in that now. But this ſmall Poet vents none but his own, and his by whoſe care

and directions this Stage is govern'd, who has for many yeares both in his fathers dayes, and ſince directed Poets to write &amp; Players to ſpeak, till he traind up theſe youths here to what they are now. I ſome of 'em from before they were able to ſay a grace of two lines long to have more parts in their pates then would fill ſo many Dry|fats. And to be ſerious with you, if after all this, by the venemous practiſe of ſome, who ſtudy nothing more then his deſtruction, he ſhould faile us, both Poets and Players would be at loſſe in Reputation. But this is from our Poet agen, who tels you plainly all the helps he has or deſires; And let me tell you he has made prety merry Jigges that ha' pleas'd a many.
