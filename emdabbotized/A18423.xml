            <p>RIGHT noble and worthy Assembly: It hath beene a
very auncient and la●dable custome, in the best go|uerned
common-wealthes, to admit and fauourably to
allow interludes and discourses vpon the Stage for diuers
reasons; but especially two. The one, to entertaine the wel|conditioned
people with some delightfull and fruitfull con|ceits,
thereby as it were to deceiue idlenes of that time which
it had allotted for worse purposes. The other, for the iust
reprehension of such as with serious and more graue adui|sings
cannot or will not be so freely admonished and corre|cted.
The later of these two respects hath begotten this
<hi>Dialogue,</hi> ready to b● acted, principally and specially poin|ting
that <hi>Impe</hi> which is infortunately fostered vp to this
day, to ruine it selfe with infamy. Onely this comfort is af|forded,
that if he be present, and withall silent, he may sup|pose
that of all others it concernes not him. If hee be absent
(as most likely he is) then euery other that findes himselfe
parcell guilt may see the deformity, and forbeare the excesse.
Other touches and passages are, which our Author and wee
present not with minde to offend any, but to please the wel|disposed.
And so in the name of all the rest I entreate
●ourteous ●udience, and pardon of all faults.</p>

people? So soone as we arriue, we
are attended to the <hi>Burse</hi> or <hi>Rande|vou</hi>
of Merchants. There we walke
as if the whole world hath neede to
be informed, yea and directed by vs
in matters of greatest moment; such
as is trafficke and commerce with forraine nations, and the
state and disposition of those kingdomes through which we
haue passed. For it may be we can giue intelligence of pre|parations
and invasions. We can demonstrate their strength
and munition. We can number their Captaines and Gene|rals.
We can discouer their designes and confederates. And
finally, we can lay plots to crosse and make voide all their
purposes, and stratagems, which these home-bred and coun|trie
spunne people can neuer attaine vnto. Therefore by
good right we are had in esteeme, and speciall request, and
courteously receiued of Councellors of state wheresoeuer
we come. Neither doe w● tye our selues to any one domini|on
more then another, but indifferently to all states we de|liuer
freely the condition of euery nation. And the place we
●●ll i●●o is our best beloued so long as there we tarry, and
<pb facs="4"/>
not a minute longer. We oblige our selues to no Prince for
gold nor gaine, nor be pensioners to any Monarche: but
with desire to see more we passe through all gouernements,
vnchecked and vncontrolled, because we take part with
none, offend, none, nor are false to any. And this life wee
loue aboue all liues, not content with any life, but that
which seekes an other life.</p>

                  <p>No? what if I should first reade a Sermon preached
within these seuen dayes at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> by a man of most
pure profession and inuention not ordinary, passing all that
liued before or behind him in the nouell straine; himselfe of
the right cut of <hi>Carolstadius:</hi> in which Sermon hee prooues
most deucutly, that it is Idolatry to fight against the Turke.
Wouldst thou not heare that first?</p>

                  <p>Well, since you are so desirous, you shall haue them
by whole sale, retaile them at leysure when you come home.</p>
                  <p>Imprimis, when he liueth in a great towne like, London,
he loues to lye in a corner ouer the Kitchen, because the Iack
shall not whirle too often, to waken or distract him in pray|er.
His dinners are for the most part ordinary, except foure
dayes in the weeke he visite his house-keeping friends. And
at supper a couple of egges, and a bit of cheese is a choyce
dyet after a liberall dinner: besides it saues fire and washing
of dishes.</p>

                  <speaker>Simp.</speaker>
                  <p>But if I were his man, if he kept no better cheere
at his chamber▪ I would make the cheesefrye vntill the but|ter

                  <p>But your cunning would fayle you, for hee hath a
tricke beyond your reach for preseruing his cheese. But to
the next.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hee so cauils and wrangles with any man that
<pb facs="5"/>
he deales withall, that they ne●er agree or loue after, and
yet euery Saterday he makes eauen with all the world.</p>

and vn●ure reports, that it passeth the skill of any man to
ca●y himselfe vprightly, &amp; without blame, I begin to iudge
you, and your like onely happy, who chuising to leaue the
world, haue procured quietnesse to your life. But Sir <hi>Her|mito,</hi>
I marvaile what hath remoued you from your caue to
the countrie. Are you as weary of private liuing, as I am of
too much company? The newes must needes be great, and

Farre be it from my thought euer to wish the change of my
estate. As now I am I trouble not others, nor any man of|fendeth
me. And where no mistake is, who can thinke of al|teration?
my resolution hath bred my contentment: the
peace which I enjoy, counter-valueth all maner of wants.
And my spiritual excercises take away tediousnes. The cause
of my comming hither (Sir <hi>Securus</hi>) is a Proclamation late|ly
set forth by the king, that all his subject being men of
21 yeares, &amp; vpwards, living within 50 miles of the Court,
shall appeare there within 14 days after notice given them.
And about three dayes past, a pilgrim passing by my cell,
told me of this Edict, and that it was vpon alleageance. So
I being his subject (thogh seruing him to no other purpose,
but praying for him) thought it my dutie to make my ap|pearance.
and to depart without delay.</p>

                  <p>They did in those daies giue grea● honour to such
as suffered death for Christian religion, although the men
were as poore as Christs fi●shermen. And therefore the daies
of their martyrdome they kept holy, and came to Church to

my pretie barnes? Why, I haue a boy, his name is <hi>Iacke;</hi> hee
has a face as welfavor'd as any great turnippe root, with a
cracke in the mid'st, which is the very proportion of his
mouth. I will not willingly leaue that boy for all the deaths
in the world. No I will not. But if I must needs dye whether
I will or no, I wood haue death take mee asleepe, that I may
not see his face, for if I did I would run away as hard as ever
I could for my life.</p>

<hi>●rgomen▪</hi> I make it iust as they did theirs at <hi>Cambridg●</hi> abou●
my nag. I remember the words, and shall doe as long as my
nag liues. For one of them spouted thus. <hi>Every horse hath
<pb n="25" facs="15"/>
stones: but this beast hath no stones;</hi> Ergo <hi>he is no horse.</hi> And
I clapt him on the backe and told him that hee spake truth.
For I gelt him the last yeare, and eat his stones to my break|fast.
But I had like to haue mar'd all by saying so. For there
was a nimble-headed Scholler that stood by, (and yet had
nothing to doe with the question) went about to proue me
a horse, and thus he began. <hi>Euery liuing beast, or Animal,
that hath in him horse stones, is a horse. But this Animal,</hi>
(meaning me) <hi>hath horse stones in him, Ergo he is a horse.</hi> I
was striken in such a maze (knowing that I did eate the
horse stones) that I was like to sinke where I stood, and euen
presently to congeale into a horse. But there was by chance
an honest Scholler by, who saw my colour quite gone, took
pity on me, and bade me be of good cheere, I shood not be
a horse. And told the tother to his face, that there was a
<hi>flacy</hi> in his <hi>argumen.</hi> And then fetcht him about with a <hi>R●|cumbentibus,</hi>
and prou'd that the horse stones which I had
eaten, were consum'd, and became such stuffe as I cannot tel
you without Sir <hi>reuerence</hi> of your teeth; and that they did
not grow in me as they doe in horses: <hi>Ergo</hi> the case was al|ter'd.
Then vpon this point of growing, and not growing,
there was such a sturre, that all the horse-coursers in the
Faire came about vs. One said they did grow, another de|nyed
it▪ and such part taking on both sides, that in the end I
was content (being desirous to make them friends) to bee
search't in the open market, and so was cleer'd before them
all to haue no more stones then I shood haue. And glad was
I that I was not a horse. Had not I (thinke you good cause
to remember <hi>Logicke?</hi> Yes, I shall neuer forget it if I should
liue 100 yeares.</p>

for you marre the paly, you are very forward to take
the tale out of my mouth, as if you had more wit, but I think
not so. I began first to speake vnto this man, therefore I wil
haue the last word. Sir, our busines with you shalbe short▪
for I am a hot fellow, and I strike thick and short. This Tai|ler
takes long and wide stitches, and drawes out the time to
make his worke seeme much. Our difference is for the <hi>Ho|ly-dayes</hi>
as they stand in the Kalender, whether it were fitter
they should be retourn'd into working-daies as they were
at the first, or remaine to the worlds end. If you iudge they
ought to stand, we are content, and will worke harder at o|ther
times. If you will haue them downe, doe but say the

                  <p>Your questiō is not hard to decide, &amp; fit enough for
me to deliuer mine opinion in. It is true, they were all work|ing
daies at the first. For which purpose it is said, such work
as thou doest, worke it in those six daies, and not on the sea|uenth
day. Yet <hi>God</hi> did neuer forbid any of those six daies
to be kept holy▪ And the Christian Church hath appointed
many daies to be kept holy in memory of Saints which suf|fered
dive●se torments for Christs sake, who suffered all for
them, and for them all. And those to be kept to the worlds
end, that their facts and fame might neuer die, but enco●|rage
others to treade their bloudie but <hi>Heauenly</hi> steppes.
<pb facs="17"/>
Therefore since the Church of <hi>God</hi> and custome of Christi|an
countries haue so ordered it, let no mans private rashnes
presume such alte●ation, as to make away or put out the
<hi>Holy-dayes,</hi> but with due reverence to obserue them.</p>

                  <p>Sir, the bargaine with Master <hi>Pohssib</hi> is the worst
that ever was made: for if he or his wife doe liue 30 yeares,
(as by probabilitie they will) you lose 17000^l. by the bar|gaine
at least. And if they die sooner, you shall saue litle.
Therefore my advice is, that either you buy it absolutely for
readie monie, or yeeld it backe with reasonable considera|tion
for your monie lent, so shall you be free from exclama|tions.</p>

Then goe we on visitation from chamber to chamber: and
before wee know perfectly how euery one had their health

               <p>I haue had such a stirre with this same begger <hi>Pohssib,</hi> his
wife, and his friends: and so many complaints they haue
made to the King and Councill, and turne themselues into
all shapes and faces to force mee either to goe through with
the bargaine or giue it ouer, that diverse of my friends are
brought to favour his part for starke equities sake. But doe
all what they can I will haue it, and not haue it: I will hold
it, and not hold it. And I will none of the purchase, and yet
not giue it over.</p>

I my selfe; but I can best guesse, because I know his poore e|state.
I haue made a priuie search into his debts; and some
creditors I haue pull'd vpon him sooner then they meant.
And in writing I haue every summe he oweth to neighbors,
to workemen, and to his very servants. And this is the
plummet I sound withall. This must bring the fi●h into my

it cannot be, for the more you striue to break their stomack▪
the more it growes; like <hi>camamile,</hi> the more you tread it, the

springs. But take a twig by the top▪ and gently bend it by
litle and litle, it will grow in what fashion you will. A wasp
is a shrewd stinging beast by nature, but if shee light vpon
your face and hands, and creepe vp and downe, let her a|lone,
and take her pleasure, she will doe you no harme, and
quietly passe away. So if your wife will meddle with all
things, giue her libertie to doe what she will, you shall haue
her merry els she were worse then the Divell.</p>

so that being now but sixe yeares old he will fight, scratch,

breake if he may not haue his will in every thing. Then is
there no way but giue it him, or els he will die with skre|ming.
O, he will proue a man of outragious spirit. It makes
me sometimes doubt he should not be my child, he hath so
noble a stomacke, farre beyond mine. And, but that I know
his mother to be a verie religious professour, I assure you it
would trouble me much, he discovereth s● much furie in his

some armes from the king of Heraulds appropriated to our

               <p>It is even high time the world were at an end, for I think
all trades are decaying: when my father put me to the Innes
of Court he advised me in anie case to studie, so that I might
be called to the barre, and then (saith he) feare not to liue in
all plentie and credit. But I find it otherwise, for now that I
am exalted thither, my law serues mee not to get my com|mons.
I wish I had beene bred a Tapster: that trade is now
more gainefull with froth then ours with all our words. And
for anie thing I see tis like to last to the worlds end, whereas
ours can be good no longer then people bee contentious.
And that is a speciall argument the ale. sellers vse against vs,
saying that we gaine by falling out of neighbours, &amp; frends
but they grow rich by meeting of good fellowes, and sit|ting
together lovinglie. There are so manie hinderances
grownevp of late that it is impossible our raigne should
long continue although it be true (and wee complaine not)
that malice is as great among men as ever it was, and can be
wished: but the mischiefe is, their monie failes, &amp; they grow
wiser.</p>

haue you not the whole kingdome at your service &amp; becke?
<pb facs="31"/>
what Lord, Knight, Gentleman, Merchant, Husbandman,
or other sort of people is not attendant at your studie dores,
with paying and praying? and glad that the fee which hee
giues is of that glorious operation, that it breeds no wrin|cles
in your forehead, but is cheerefullie receaued? What
<hi>co●gees,</hi> and submissiue requests to peruse their case with a
little care? What troupes conduct you to the barre? What
venison sent to your feafts? What respect and entertaine|ment
if you vouchsase to visite their countrie houses? And
finally, what honour and homage can bee done to subiects,
but you haue it in all fulnes, and yet you whine as not con|tented.
I perceiue you would murmure if you were so hand|led
as poore merchants are, that vnlesse we turne Vsurers,
we cannot liue.</p>

                  <p>You complaine without cause <hi>Mureto.</hi> Your
case is farre better then ours: for if one countrie or commo|ditie
afford not gaine, you can go into another, and choppe
and change as often as you list. We are tied to one countrie
and place. You may offer your wares▪ and are sure to haue
trafficke as the times and prices be. We may not tender our
service to anie, but sit gaping in our chambers, as melancho|licke
as mice, vntill some bodie chance to knocke at the

Surelie the world might well spare of both sorts of
you a great number. Concerning you Master <hi>Mureto,</hi> it is
cleare that you play the merchant with vs, who bite and
whine at your impositions. although you lose nothing; but
the whole burden thereof falles vpon them who spend the
commodities, and must ere they buy, pay the shot of your
impositions whatsoever it be.</p>
                  <p>And for you Master Lawyer, that grow fat with the
drops which fals from other mens browes, and be merrie
with the frets that gall the Clyents hearts: whose griefe
is alwayes to heare of peace and charity; and reioyce with
the Fox, that the hennes fall out for their pearch: what faul●<pb n="57" facs="31"/>
finde you with this world that was never so rich with envy,

against you for hoording vp co●ne against a deare yeare, for
selling to badgers at a deare rate, and not serving the mar|ket:
for mingling bad corne with the good, and fowle dres|sing
of the best. For deceitfull plowing your neighbours
ground that hires you at a hard rate, which makes the poore

which breed new cases among old Lawyers, which I could

great dyet I had was sometimes a piece of cheefe, and one

him challenge no deeds at my hands. He never had more of
me then my word for that he now claimeth. And doth hee
thinke to build castles vpon my word? if he doe, they shall

                  <p>For the high prices of corne (which falsely and
absurdly you impute vnto husbandmen) if you had either
wit or honestie you would soone graunt that there are two
maine reasons for it which lye not in our power to redresse,
but in the States wisdome to helpe. One is, the vncontrol|led
<pb n="62" facs="34"/>
and improvident libertie for all sorts &amp; degrees to mar|rie,
so that many are grand-mothers at 30 yeares old. The
other is the multitude of Inclosures and decay of tillage.
And if we corne-men did not till all the ground we can get;
how deare (thinke you) would corne bee shortly? Many
other Reasons for brevity sake I omit, but these will hold
argument against you for tearme of both your liues, and
after your decease to your heires males lawfully begot|ten.</p>

                  <speaker>Secu.</speaker>
                  <p>To deale plainely with you all, mine opinion is,
that the world is generally more wronged and abused by
the Lawyer and merchant, then by the Farmer, who though
<pb n="63" facs="34"/>
he haue faults, yet gets he his liuing more honestly, and is of
necessitie to be harboured. But Sir <hi>Hermito</hi> I must referre
the full decision of their cause to your censure.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Her.</speaker>
                  <p>That one of them is better then the other, I doe
not see; therefore me thinkes the question should rather be
which is the worst. The Farmer that deceiues so farre as
his capacity will carry him, is condemned by his intention
to doe worse if his skill did enable him.</p>
                  <p>The Lawyer is a necessary member of the commonwelth
to finde and determine everie mans right. But if willingly
he oppugne right, and be enemie to peace, he is the <hi>Diuels
agent,</hi> and Christs enemie.</p>
                  <p>Likewise a merchant which causeth commerce and ami|tie
betweene severed nations is a man commendable. But
if he vse fraud, then is he pestiferous, and deserueth banish|ment
where no societie is.</p>

this fellow that hath the purse is Iudas. the figure of 30 with
<hi>p</hi>-ioin'd to it signifies 30 pence, for which he sold his master.
That which followeth is meant of Christ, worth a hundred
worlds: for which fact the Divell put a halter about his neck

the price too is monstrous: groates apeece? why, it were
enough for a supper at my chamber. Indeed they were very

too deare. Tell him from me, I will not allow him a penie

                  <p>There is also another bill against you by your
wiues neere cosen, wherein you are charged (not directly
with stealing, but taking without the owners privitie or cō|sent)
a picture, a map, and other houshold stuffe.</p>

                  <p>I make no more reckning of that imputation then

                  <p>But one thing made me laugh hartelie, and in my
conceit it was a wittie tricke that was told me latelie, that
you borrowed 100● of a gentlewoman called <hi>Mis●ris Fer|●ers
Gratis,</hi> and put it out for 10 in the 100. And after a
yeare and a halfe with much ado● paid her: and so you got
15● handsomelie. I would I could tell whereto borrow two
or three 1000● in that sort. Me thinks I haue wit enough to
thriue on this fashion.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ant.</speaker>
                  <p>Tis a fine way indeed, and cleanelie (so that a m●̄
looke to his securitie) And comes in without stoc●e of his
owne: a verie begger may grow rich thus: and everie paul|trie
knaue may thriue so, if he take heed. Millers vse this
tricke to lend a bushell of another mans corne ground into
meale to be paid againe in wheate, so he takes tole twice of
one bushell, and no cost of his owne, It is but making the

                  <speaker>Sim.</speaker>
                  <p>There are yet two other things obiected, but both
of our nature therefore though it were a huddle, it makes
but a single game. One was this that you picked the first le●|ter
out of a truncke ful of linnen, (the letter for the surname
seruing your name as well as the owners youle● stand) and
put on A. insteed of R. which was picked out. And this was
M^r. <hi>Rellips</hi> linnen. The other was that you marked pillowes,
and oth●r stuffe o● a noble mans with your own marke, and
●sed them as your owne. I forgot the noble mans name but
it sounds like a port towne toward the sunne when it is at
the highest. They had much of their stuffe againe, but some
●●ucke in your finger●. And reason too I thinke: shall a man
take pa●nes to marke another mans goods for nothing? A
halter for him that hath no better wit then so, to thriue by.</p>

                  <speaker>Ant.</speaker>
                  <p>It must serue. for they shall never proue directly

                  <speaker>Sim.</speaker>
                  <p>But they were found in your possession. and then
how can you avoid the discredit?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ant.</speaker>
                  <p>Discredit? they may bee glad to haue their things
●gaine. who can tell but they be mine? I am sure they na●●
my marke. And how shall a man know his owne but by his

them out of memorie.</p>

                  <speaker>Sim.</speaker>
                  <p>All these are well answered. What sa●e you Sir to
the taking of a conveiance out of a painted boxe in your fa|ther
in lawes studie▪ by meanes of a keye with pretence of
another businesse?</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>Tush. I ●aid it there againe when I saw they kept
such a stirre about a paultrie peece of parchment. I will not

                  <p>What an vnkindnesse was that, tha● your father in

<pb facs="42"/>
Sir I see you haue beene much wronged among them. Hang
such a father.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ant.</speaker>
                  <p>I but I dealt well enough with him: for I sent him
word that if he did sue me I would bring him in more trou|ble
then twice so much monie could excuse him for other
matters.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sim.</speaker>
                  <p>And reason too I thinke. shal they make a man pay
monie before he be willing? twood make a man doe that
awood not, when they goe to extremities. I haue done for
this time Sir. the next time you call for newes I hope I shall
haue as much more. But now I remember mee there is one
thing more. Your lawyer asked mee for a fee for your last
businesse: shall I giue it him?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Ant.</speaker>
                  <p>No. I am sure he did not aske you. I brought a co|sen
of mine tother day to him that gaue him a fee. Indeed I
told him that he should goe to my lawyer and giue him no
fee. But when I had him there, and he put his case, I whis|per'd
my cosen in the eare to offer him a fee: But I did not
whisper my lawyer to refuse it. and so verie honestlie hee
tooke it: and I knowe therefore hee will expect no fee for
my owne businesse.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sim.</speaker>
                  <p>Then belike I mistooke it. perchance hee thank'd
you for bringing your cosen to giue him a fee without
cause, being well resolved before by other Councell. Well
now Sir I hope you will bestow my freedome vpon me. I
desire no more cunning then now I haue, and Ile serue you
still, and set vp for my selfe: for I had rather bee a double
knaue then a single foole.</p>

his) then the remnant he packeth vp thus. And at the next

yet this English I picke out of it, that you may haue a hus|band
as your mother had. And then if it please you, I may

well, but thy capacitie is verie muddie. Wouldst thou not
haue thy wife vow chastitie, but be an harlot? there is cha|stity
and continencie among married folke, so long as they
be faithfull each to other. But virginitie goes further: and
that is sequestred continencie during life, not admitting
companie for procreation.</p>

you will heare no motion to ouerthrow this order againe.
And now tell me, what say you to my vow, which in all e|qu●tie
must be performed. You see I was content (though
much against my minde) that you should haue kept your
vow of virginitie, (if so had stood your resolution) now I
appeale to your owne court for Iustice, and hope you will
giue as good way to the fulfilling of my vow, which is ne|ver

such (I doubt not) you haue made, and quickly brok●n;
<pb n="98" facs="53"/>
and this of the same mettle, &amp; so will proue as bri●le. Cour|tlers
vowes of this nature are but words, a little more stiffly
blowne out of their mouthes, then the rest of their speech,
but come no neerer their hearts. The gunner puts a little
more powder in the gun to make it carrie the shot further,
but hits the marke no whit the righter: So they driue their
vowes with a little stronger breath, but their intention i●
not the streighter.</p>

him credit the better, and perhaps I was within ●●ght and
hearing too, when this gentleman was so loue-sicke as
you speake of, which made me in verie pitie come the soo|ner
in to relieue him. And I would not haue you think <hi>Par|vagracio</hi>
that I am disdainefull, for that winneth nothing
but hatred: nor am I cruel, for that is euer payed home with
extreame miserie. Now yet am I proud (which vice you

time for eating: there is no meat: my Master does not vie to
quilt his frends stomack● with too much meat. No, hee
would speake with you about a note he hath caused to bee
drawne he will 〈◊〉 you to p●rvse it, and do him a favour
it is in the nature of a certificate.</p>

of him to some friend of our● in some small request

                  <p>Mary Sir with as wide and large a conscience as a|ny

                  <p>If he doe then I hope hee will teach mee cunning
worth 100^l to deceaue others. &amp; so I may double my 100^l.
For I doe not thinke but hee hath gotten manie 100^l with
art. And Ile never leaue him tell I get all his tricks and now
he hath made me free he will vse me as his fellow.</p>

best to permit the least: but if a man haue freedome 〈◊〉
best choice is to refuse evill be it never so little. Among ●he
severall discourses this day acted. I note many vices va●l●d
over with froth, and florish of words, but the same againe
vnma●ked with substantiall matter, and laid naked to di●|grace.
So it 〈◊〉 they are not propounded to imitate,
but 〈◊〉 forth to be sha●ed. They are pa●nted in colour● but
in a map of 〈…〉 some 〈…〉,
but such as runne to ruine. They are brought forth to be
rewed; but to manifest their vglinesse. They come not here
●o be liked, but lothed; not to be fau●red, but derided. Not
●llowed in private, but in publike to be condemned. S● I
●ope that all wise hearers will a●oid the sinnes and abuse●●ere touched (which are many) and follow good counsell
●f they heard any. Which that they may doe my part is to
●ray to the g●uer of wisdome. And so Sir, wishing much pro
peritie to your charitable endeavours, I take leaue▪ and the
