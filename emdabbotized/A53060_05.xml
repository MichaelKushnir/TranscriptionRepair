                     <p>Great Queen! I, nor no other, should offer, or dare to speak before, or to such Supreme persons as your Majesty, without a sore preme|ditation; for the words and behaviours of speakers should be fitted to the de|grees and qualities, Powers, Offices, and Authorities of the Auditory; But your Majesties commands makes that an obedient duty, that would other|wayes be a presumption; wherefore, on the ground of duty I speak at this time before your Majesty; but the Royalty of your person, the brightnesse of your beauty, the fame of your vertues, and the glorious splendour of your Majestical Grandeur hath so amazed me, that my understanding is as it were blind, which will cause my tongue to stagger, and my words to run stumbling out of my mouth; but I hope your Justice will pardon them; For, as Divine Justice belongs to the Gods, moral Justice to Nature; so humane Justice to Monarchial Princes, which justice is weighed and measured out according to merit, or desert, be they good or bad: For which Justice Gods and Prin|ces are both feared and loved; and Justice is the chief Pillar or upholder of Monarchical States and Common-wealths; for without Justice there can be no Government, and without Government there can be no Rule, and without Rule there can be no peace, and where peace is not, there will be warrs and, warrs causeth ruine and destruction; But for the most part, those Kingdomes that have arrived to the height of Glory, declines or falls to ruine: The reason is, that a low condition is necessitated, and weak; wherefore they seek for help to strengthen themselves, which makes or rather forces every particular person to associate, &amp; unite either by Laws of Covenants, to which they submit and obey: But when a Kingdom is in a Glorious condition, and is full of prosperity, every particular Citizen or man thinks he can stand upon his own foundation, flinging off their suppor|ters, which is Duty, and obedience, which makes them fall to ruine; For when men comes to that height of pride, caused by prosperity, that they all strive to be Superiours, and Commanders; they become Factious and muti|nous against the Magistrates, Rulers, or Governours; which Factions begets warrs, either by calling in Forriegners, or by making, or siding into parties a|mongst themselves; for it is to be observed, that States, or Monarchies do oftner fall by the pride and Factions of the Commons, or Subjects, than by the Tyranny of the Rulers or Governours; But it is the nature of the vulgar sort of man-kind, to be the most basest, fearfulest &amp; dejected Creatures in ad|versity, that Nature hath made, and in prosperity to be the proudest, insulting|est and imperious and cruelest of all Creatures. But Kings and Royal Prin|ces should do as Gods, which is to keep their Subjects in aw, with the Super|stitious fear of Ceremonies; wherefore Princes should do no actions, no, not the meanest, without Ceremony to astonish the vulgar; for Ceremonies be|gets
<pb n="156" facs="90"/>
fear, fear begets Superstition, Superstition Reverence, Reverence Obedi|ence, Obedience brings Peace, Peace brings Tranquility; But where Cere|monie is not used, the Gods are neglected, and Princes dispised; for Ceremo|nie is the Throne which Gods and Princes sits on, which being pulled a|way, they fall from their Glory; for Ceremonie is the Royal Crown which makes them Majestical, it is the Scepter by which they rule, it is the Altar at which all the Subjects kneel, do bow, and they offer up there their natural free liberty.</p>
                     <p>But most glorious Princess, you and your Subjects are like the Sun, and the rest of the Planets, moving perpetually, keeping their proper Sphere, they moving in civiler loyalty about you, to receive the light of your Authority, and you move in them as the just center, spreading your glorious beams round about the Circumference of your Dominions, and in the light of your com|mands they see their duty: And your Laws are like the fixed Starrs, which twinkling move in the night of great offences, and doth assist the innocent with sparkling light. And your Majesty governs like the Gods, your wis|dome by your Works is known, and by your Wisdome is your Power Immense.</p>

drawn or turned by the Loadstone of affection, to the North-pole of Experi|ence, to guide me safe from the Rocks of slander, and quick-sands of scandal, till I come to the Port of death, there to unload my Lifes Merchandise; and I hope my Voyage may be so prosperous, as I may be inriched with the praises of After-Ages.</p>
                     <p>Likewise, the reason why I choose to speak in publick, is, that I would not speak idely, for in publick I shall take care of what I speak, and to whom I speak, when in private visitations to single persons, my speech may be care|lesse with negligence, in which I may throw away my time with my words; For, to speak to no purpose, is to make words useless, and words is the marks to distinguish things, and Figures to number merits with, and Notes to record the noble Acts of men.</p>
                     <p>But at this time I am to speak by my Fathers command, upon a Subject which my contemplation hath no acquaintance with, which is marriage, and I hear by my Father, that you have all treated with him, or rather intreated him to bestow me in marriage, which is to make me unhappy, not but that I believe what I hear, which is, that you are all persons of Quality, Birth, Breed|ing, and Merit, far beyond my desert, yet with the best, if any best there be, being all worthy; yet were I a wife to any one, I might be unhappy, by rea|son marriage is an incumbered life, although the Husband and the Wife were fitly matcht for years, Births, Fortunes, Dispositions, Humours, Capacities, Wits, Conversations, Constancies, Vertues, and affections; and first, by your leave, I will discourse of mens marriage, by reason Man being accounted the Supremer Creature, and alwayes bearing Rule, he shall be first placed. As for marriage, to men it is a great hinderance to a speculative life, it cuts off Phancies Wings, and quenches out the Poetical Fire, it breaks the Engine of invention, disturbs sweet contemplation, corrupts honest Counsels, ob|structs all Heroick actions, obscures fame, and often times causes infamy by the wifes inconstancies, and many times by her indiscretion; for a man is dis|honoured if his wife is but thought wanton, or but inclining to be amorous, and though she be as sober in her Nature, and as constant as any woman can be, yet the very suspition is a disgrace, and if the suspition is a disgrace, what is a visible truth? His very Neighbours makes Horns as he passeth by their doors, whilst he sadly and shamefully hangs down his head with a dejected countenance, which makes him seem a Coward and a Fool, although it be unjust that the faults of the wife should be a blemish to the Husbands honour; yet so it is, this being the greatest cause why Husbands are jealouse, which jealousie is more for their Honours sake, than for their Wives affections; thus you see how dangerous a thing it is for man to marry, who must trust his honour to the management of a Foolish Woman, and women naturally like children, inconstant, unlesse education doth rectifie their frail natures, pee|vish humours, various appetites, and inconstant affection: Likewise mar|riage is not only apt to corrupt the mind with jealousie, but with Covetous|nesse; for the extreme fondnesse and natural love of Parents to their Chil|dren, maks them strive by all their endeavours to inrich them; this makes them gripe their Tennants, pinch and half starve their servants, quarrel and dispute with their neighbours, corrupt Judges take Bribes, besides it makes men apt to rebell, and turn Traitorus, murmuring at their Taxes and impositions, it also makes them timorous and fearful in warrs, by reason their wife and chil|dren may be ruined by their death. Also it makes them dull in their Con|versations,
<pb n="160" facs="92"/>
by reason they are alwayes plodding for their worldly affairs; and for the Muses, had a husband time to entertain them, yet the wife would right them, or drive them from him, with their quarreling disputes, or sencelesse prizes; besides most women are as jealouse of the Muses, as of their Maids; but to treat or discourse of married women, is to discourse of a most unhappy life, for all the time of their lives is insnared with troubles, what in breeding and bearing children, what in taking and turning away Ser|vants, directing and ordering their Family, counting their expences, and dis|bursing their revenues, besides the vexations with their servants, for their quarreling and combining, for their sloth and sluttery, for their spoiles and carlessnesse, for their treachery and couzenage, and if they have Children, what troubles and griefs do unsue? Troubled with their frowardnesse and un|towardnesse, the care for their well being, the fear for their ill doing, their grief for their sicknesse, and their unsufferable sorrow for their death; Yet this is the best part, and not to be avoided: But if these troubles be joyned with an ill Husband, it heightens their torments; for if he be a Drunkard, she had better be marryed to a Beast, her nostrils is stencht with the Lees of wine, her eyes are offended with his rude behaviour, and her ears are struck with a cursed noise of cursing and Oaths; and if he be a Gamester, she lives in an unsetled condition, she knows not how soon she may want; for if she have plenty one day, she may be in a condition to beg the next. And if her Hus|band be inconstant, and loves variety of women: O how jealousie torments her, besides the wrongs she suffers from him! what affronts she receives from his Mistresse! How is she dispised amongst her neighbours? sleighted by her servant, suspected by the world for having some defect? as either to be in|continent, sluttish, foolish, froward, crosse, unkind, ill natured, sickly, or dis|eased, when perchance the woman may be worthy to be marcht with a tem|perate, wise, valiant, honest, rich and honourable man; and if women go fine, and take pleasure in themselves, and Garments, their Husbands are jea|louse; and if they regard not themselves or Garments, their Husbands dislikes rhem; For though men will swear to their wives they like them better in their old cloaths, than other women in their glorious Apparrel; because they would not have them expensive, yet if their wives neglect themselves, regarding not their dressing, but sleights all outward Adornmentss, and change of Garments as prodigal spend-thrifts, they starve their Husbands esteem in their thrifty plainness, Consumes their affections in their peiced Petti|coates, and buries their Husbands love in their dirty raggs; And from the Dunghill of dirty raggs, and grave of soul Linnen, is their Husbands transfor|med to beastly Adulteries, stealing by degrees out of one Form into another, as from a doting Husband, to a fond Husband, form a fond to a discreet Hus|band, from a discreet, to a careful Husband, from a careful, to a carelesse, from a carelesse, to a disliking, from a disliking, to a hating, and then they be|gin to wander; As first, an eye glances, from an eye glance, to an admirer; from an admirer, to a professour, from a professour, to a dissembler; from a dissembler, to an Adulterer; then for the dresses and garments of his Mistress, First, from clean, to new; from new, to fine; from fine, to brave; from brave, to glorious; from glorious to fantastical; from fantastical to profusely vari|ous from profusely, various to any dirty Slut. But his wife (on the other side, if his wife desires) appears handsome, and practises civil behaviour, and endeavours to be sine, takes care to be cleanly, observes to be fashionable, her
<pb n="161" facs="92"/>
Husband straight becomes jealouse, although she doth this for his sake, and to keep his affection, yet he thinks it is for the affection and sake of some other man, which causeth private discontents, from private discontents to quarreling disputes; from quarreling disputes, to publick exclamations, from publick exclamations, to open defiance; from open defiance, to devorcement; and though I cannot say this by, or from experience, having it only from re|lation, yet I do as faithfully believe it, as if I were experienced therein: On which faith, I made a vow never to marry, since I hear men are so hard to please, and apt to change; wherefore if I were marryed, instead of discoursing of several arguments, <hi>I</hi> should be groaning and sighing, and weep|ing, with several pains and vexations; and instead of a silent solitary contem|plation, a clamorous quarrelsome conversation; instead of a peaceable life, I should be alwayes in civil warrs; and instead of being happy, I should be mi|serable; for mariage is like a ship, which always lyes on the roughest Bilows of the Sea, rouling from side to side with discontents, sailing uncertainly, with inconstancy, and various winds, But noble, civil, kind and affectionate Gentle|men, as I have told you, <hi>I</hi> have made a vow never to marry, and surely mar|riage is not so happy an estate, or so pleasing a condition of life, as to perswade me to break my vow, neither can flattering Rhetorick, nor inticing beauty, nor adoring, admiring, deploring, praying, weeping <hi>Suters</hi> perswade me, no, not a bleeding Suter, were <hi>I</hi> sure he would dye, did he not enjoy me; for <hi>I</hi> will never be so dishonourable, perjurious, and impious, to break the holy Laws, and pull the Virgin Altars down, built in the conscience, on which are vows offered to Gods on high: Should <hi>I</hi> blow out that with faint inconstan|cy, that pure bright Vestal Fire of innocency, from whence the Essence of chast thoughts ascends to Heaven high; But rather than <hi>I</hi> would break my vow, <hi>I</hi> wish my ears as deaf as death, that hears no flattering sounds, nor sad complaints, nor terrifying threats, my eyes as dark as night, least light should bring some false deluding object in, for to deceive me; my heart like Ada|mant, so hard love cannot enter, nor pity nor compassion wound; but how|soever, <hi>I</hi> connot be wife to you all; wherefore since <hi>I</hi> cannot be every mans wife, <hi>I</hi> will dye every mans Maid. But <hi>I</hi> must tell this Noble Assembly, their meeting hath occasioned a quarrel here; for bashfulnesse, and confi|dence hath fought a Duel in my Cheeks, and left the staines of bloud there.</p>

                     <speaker>Lady Incontinent.</speaker>

                     <l>Only I wish that Death may order it so,</l>

O death! quick dispatch, Let me unprisoned be, my body is old, decayed and worn, times ruins shews it. Oh! Oh! let life fall, for pitty pull it down. <stage>[stops a time]</stage> Am I not dead? you cruel powers above, to lengthen out an old mans life in misery and pain; why did not Time put out the sight of both my eyes, and also deaf my ears, that I might neither hear, nor see, the death of my lifes joy? O Luxurious Death, how greedily thou feedst on youth and beauty, and leist old Age hang withering on lifes tree? O shake me off, let me no longer grow, if not, grief shall by force snip off my tender stalk, and pitty lay me in the silent grave. Heark, Heark, I hear her call me? I come, I come Childe.</p>

                     <p>There, there I see her on her dutious knee; Her humble eyes cast to the ground; Her spotlesse hands held up for blessings crave, asking forgivenesse for faults not done. O no, She is dead! She is dead! I saw her eye-lids cloze
<pb n="170" facs="97"/>
like watry Clouds, which joyn to shut out the bright Sun; and felt her hands which Death made cold and numb, like as to Cristal balls; She is gone, she is gone, and restless grows my mind; thoughts strive with thoughts, &amp; struggle in my brain, passions with passions in my heart make War.</p>

Then tis not Death that affrights me, and yet I find my Soul is loath to leave its bodily Mansion; but O to be buried in Oblivions grave is all I fear; no Monumental Fame, nor famous Monument, my Soul displeases, that makes it loath to leave the body in forgotten dust, whilst it doth sadly wander in the Aire.</p>

O! O! those pretious tears! Devil that I was to grieve her sweet Nature, harmless Thoughts, and Innocent Soul. O how I hate my self, for being so unnaturally kind.

<pb n="179" facs="101"/>
wherefore most fit to speak her Funeral Oration; For I being her Father, am her longest acquaintance, and constantest Friend, and nearest in Relation, wherefore the, fitest to declare unto the world my natural and Fatherly Love, Death will be a sufficient witnesse; For though I am old, yet I was health|ful when she lived, but now I cannot live many hours, neither would I, for Heaven knows, my affections struggle with Death, to hold Life so long as to pay the last Rites due to her dead Corps, struck by Death's cruel Dart: But most Noble and Charitable Friends, I come not here with eye fil'd with sal● tears; for sorows thirsty Jaws hath drunk them up, sucked out my blood, &amp; left my Veins quite dry, &amp; luxuriously hath eat my Marow out; my sighs are spe●t in blowing out Life's Fire, only some little heat there doth remain, which my affections strive to keep alive to pay the last Rites due to my dead Child, which is, to set her praises forth, for living Virtuously; But had I <hi>Nestors</hi> years, 'twould prove too few, to tell the living Stories of her Youth, for Nature in her had packed up many Piles of Experience, of Aged times, be|sides, Nature had made her Youth sweet, fresh and temperate, as the Spring; and in her brain, Flowers of Fancies grew, Wits Garden set by Natures hand, wherein the Muses took delight, and entertained themselves therein, Singing like Nightingales, late at Night; or like the Larks ere the day begin; Her thoughts were as the Coelestial Orbes, still moving circular without back ends, surrounding the Center of her Noble mind, which as the Sun gave light to all about it; her Virtues twinkled like the fixed Starrs, whose mo|tion stirs them not from their fix'd place; and all her Passions were as other starres, which seemed as only made to beautifie her Form; But Death hath turned a Chaos of her Form, which life with Art and Care had made, and Gods had given to me: O cursed death, to rob and make me poor! Her life to me was like a delightful Mask, presenting several interchanging <hi>Scenes,</hi> de|scribing Nature in her several Dresses, and every Dresse put in a several wa●● Also her life was like a Monarchy, where Reason as sole King, did govern al her actions; which actions, like as Loyal Subjects did obey those Laws which Reason decreed; Also her life was like <hi>Ioves</hi> Mansions high, as being placed above this worldly Globe; from whence her Soul looked down on duller earth, mixt not, but viewed poor mortals here below; thus was her life a|bove the world, because her life prized not the Trifles here; Perchance this Noble Company will think I have said too much, and vainly, thus to speak.</p>
                     <l>That Fathers should not praise their Children so,</l>
                     <l>Because that from their Root and Stock did grow;</l>

               <l>Nor whipt with censure, rather let it dye</l>
               <l>Here on this Stage, and see the Funeral Rites,</l>
               <l>Which is, to put out all the Candle lights.</l>
               <l>And in the grave of darknesse let it rest,</l>
               <l>In peace and quiet, and not molest</l>
               <l>The harmlesse soul, which hopes <hi>Mercury</hi> may</l>
