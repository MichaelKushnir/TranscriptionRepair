               <l>NOble Spectators, this play that you'l see,</l>
               <l>Is taken out of Britains History;</l>
               <l>It is not pleasant, nor yields much delight,</l>
               <l>But it did serve the Poetress to write;</l>
               <l>She bids me tell you, she was glad to take</l>
               <l>Any dull plot, so she a play could make,</l>
               <l>Her vacant idle time for to imploy;</l>
               <l>For she loves writing more than Company;</l>
               <l>But if it pleases not your Eyes or sight,</l>
               <l>She doth not care, since it pleas'd her to write;</l>
               <l>For she indeavours, tryes all that she may</l>
               <l>To please her self in every honest way;</l>
               <l>Wherefore a praise, or yet applause from you,</l>
               <l>She expects not, nor challenges as her due.</l>

                     <p>Have I not cause, when I am married to a person which doth not love, but rather hate me?</p>

                     <p>Certainly he hath reason to love you, and he were worse than a Devil if he should hate you; as first to love you for your virtue and sweet disposition; next for the honour, dignity, and Kingdome, he hath got by his marring you: for he hath no right to the Dukedome but by your High|ness, and by your Highness he is become an absolute Prince, and injoyes a rich Kingdome.</p>

                     <p>He cannot, the Kingdome will never suffer him, for your title is so just, as he can make no pretence to disposess your Highness from your Princely Throne.</p>

                     <p>This Duke is young, wild, deboist and inconstant, wherefore there is but little hopes it should be better governed.</p>

                     <p>But neither her discretion, wisdome, nor virtue hath power, for marriage hath inthralled her, for she is become her Husbands Slave, who ought to be his Soveraign, but he laughs and doth despise her, because she is somewhat elder than himself.</p>

<pb n="640" facs="335"/>
unless he be Right and Lawfull Emperor: So, that unless your Highness had been Duke by Inheritance, as an Inhereditary Duke, no Children, by any other Lady, can be Inheritors, nor indeed Princes, unless they were begot on the Right Owner to that Title.</p>

                     <p>VVell, since I have no Power, but only an empty Title, I cannot disadvantage my self, or children: for I have no children as yet, and I have neither Power, nor Kingdom now: VVherefore, if I can injoy her upon these tearms, as the name of VVife, it will be well.</p>

                     <p>Yes Madam, but your Highness is forced I think to present them with some presents now and then; for the World is so wicked, that they will not give true honour it's due, unless they are bribed.</p>

                     <p>Yes, but since your Titles, Rights and Marriage is re|nounced against, they are not so civil, dutifull, and obedient as they were, not considering as they ought to do, that right cannot be renounced against.</p>

                     <p>What Title?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>2. <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Why the title of Cuckolds.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>1. <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Indeed most women do magnifie their Husbands by those Ti|tles.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>2. <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>But let me tell you, that those women that have Inheritary Ho|nours, although not Soveraigns, may indue their Husbands with the same Honour: but it is not generally so; but his Children begot on her are in|dued, and not the Husband, yet some Husbands are. As for Example; a Lord, Vicoun●, Earl, Marquiss, Duke, King, or Emperor, if the Honour, as Title, goeth to the Female, for default of a Male, in some Nations their Husbands are indued with their Titles, but not commonly known to be so in <hi>England</hi>; as a VVife with her Husband, which is only during life, and not Inhereditary: but if their Titles are only during life, and not Inhereditary, it cannot derive to another, that i● not an Successor● for Inhereditary Ho|nour goe like Intailed Lands, it goeth only to the next Heir; but those that are the dignified, are like those that have Joynters, or Annuitles for life; so when a Husband receives a Dignity from a VVife, or a VVife from a Husband, it is but so much Honour for life.</p>

                     <speaker>1. <hi>Gentleman.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>But if they have Children, those Children inherit the Ho|nour.</p>
                  </sp>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>Yes, as having a right from that Parent that is the Digni|fyer, but if there be none of the line of the Dignifyer, the Honour dies, nei|ther is the root of the Honour left to any more than one: for though the branches of Honour spread to all the Children, yet the root remains but with one: For, say a King have many Children, they are all Princes, but yet there can be but one that can inherit the Crown and Royaltie: So if a Marquiss, or Duke have many Children, they are all Lords and Ladies, if they be lawfully, and in true VVedlock born, otherwise they are not: neither doth any more but one of the Legitimate Children inherit the Root, as to be Marquess or Duke, Dutchess or Marchioness: neither do the Daughters inherit, if there be Sons.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>But cannot a Dukes Daughter make her Husband a Prince?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>2. <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>No, not except she hath the Inhereditary Honour: for if a Kings Daughter should marry a private Gentleman, he would remain as only in the Title of a Gentleman, unless the King did create a Title for him, or be|stow a Title on him.</p>

                     <p>VVhy? put case the Inhereditary Honour lay in the people, and they elect a King, hath that King no power to Create, or to give Ho|nour?</p>

                     <p>No, they may chuse Officers, but not give Titles, unless the peo|ple did dispossess them of their hereditary power, and give it to any man, and then the root of Honour lyes in him.</p>

                     <speaker>2. <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>No, for the Title he hath, is none of his, he hath it but during life, unless the people will give a Lease, as for two or three Lives, yet they nominate those two or three Lives: So neither can they dispose of their Leases, or alter them, but at the peoples pleasure; like as those that are made Governors, they cannot dispose of their Governments to whom they please, as without the leave of those that placed them in the Government, neither do his Children receive any Titles therefrom; like as a Lord Mayor, his Son is not my Lord Mayor after him, unless he is made one; nor his chil|dren have no place by his Office, and an elective Prince, is but as a Lord Mayor, or rather like as a Deputy Governor, who as I said, may dispose of Places or Offices, but not give Dignities, Honours, or Titles.</p>

                     <p>A puppet Play you mean; but the truth is, it is a disgrace to all noble persons, and great dignities, and true titles, to be thus mocked by imi|tators, it is a sign that all <hi>Europe</hi> is imbroiled in Wars so much as every one doth what they list.</p>

                     <p>VVhy they are so far from being checkt or discountenanced for it, as there are many true Princes, great and noble persons as give the same respect and homage as if they were real Princes indeed and in truth.</p>

                     <p>Then it if it were in my power I would divest those that had the right, and true dignities, and titles, and put them upon those that only acted princely and royal parts, since the Actors bear up so nobly, and the Specta|tors do creep and crouch so basely: but indeed both sides are Actors, both the Spectators and Players, only the one side Acts noble parts, the other side base parts, the one Acts the parts of Princes, the other of Servants; but I am sorrow to see <hi>True Honour</hi> wounded as it is.</p>

                     <p>I will instruct you in the degrees of Princes, and their derivation; but first, let me tell you, the Princely Arms, or Seal, is a Crown; for a Crown is the General Arms, or Seal of all Princely Dignities, and eve|ry

degree is known and distinguished by the several fashions of their Crowns; for a Vicounts Crown, which is the first degree of a Prince, is not like the Earls Crown, which is the second degree; nor an Earls Crown is not like a Marquisses Crown, which is the third degree; that is, t●ere is some dif|ference in the Crown; nor a Marquisses Crown is not like a Dukes Crown, which is the fourth degree; nor a Dukes Crown is not like a close Imperi|al Crown, which is the last and highest degree; that is, there is some dif|ference in the Crown of each degree: Now there are Absolute Princes, Tributary, and Subject Princes, but none can be wholly call'd Absolute Prin|ces, but those that have the Imperial Crown, which are Absolute Kings and Emperors, being the only chosen of God, and by that the only Creators of Titles; for they only are the Fountain, or Springs of Honour.</p>

                     <speaker>Lady True Honour.</speaker>
                     <p>By Adoption: for all Subject Princes are Princes by Adoption: that is, they are adopted to their Princely Dignity, so that by Adoption, they are the Cosens to Royaltie, and are called by their Sove|raigns, Kings Cosens, and are adorn'd with Royal Robes, indued with Roy|al Power, and observed with Royal Ceremony, and are allowed some Cu|stoms and Imposts out of the Revenue of the Kingdom, and many privileges which belong to the Princely Dignities: Thus Kings call their Subject Princes, Cosens, as being adopted to their Princely Royaltie, like as all Ab|solute Monarchs call each other Brother, as in relation to each others Roy|alty: and being all of them Gods annointed, and appointed Deputies on Earth, for Government and Honour, they are the sacred Magistrates of God, the divine Fountains of Honour: Thus true Honour is derived from Heaven, and ought to be respected, and bowed too, as being divine: but in this age Honour is used, or abused, as other divine things are: this is the reason I will not visit the Apocriphal Ladies: for my Honour is derived from the sacred Spring of Honour, and is not a self-given Honour and Dig|nity, which ought to be punished as a Presumption and Usurpation: but I have so much Honour, as not to abase the Honour and Dignity that my Husband, and his Fore-fathers were adopted too: And I by Marriage, be|ing one with my Husband; for man and wife are but one, and my Husbands Honour being Inhereditary, succeeds to his Children; wherefore his Wife will never give place to Mountebanks.</p>

                     <speaker>Lady True Honour.</speaker>
                     <p>But if Royaltie will suffer such Heresies, and Hereticks in the Court of Honour, they are not to be lamented, if their Courts fall to utter ruine; for it is with Titles and Dignities, as with Laws; if there were no Laws, there would be no Government, and if there were no De|grees and dignities, there would be no Royalty; so likewise if the Laws be corrupt and abused, Government will fall to ruin, and if Honour be abused and usurpt, Royaltie will fall from its Throne; but howsoever, I keep up the Right of my place, because it is the cause and interest of all the Nobili|ty of my Country, so that if I should give place, I should be a Traytor to true Honour, and dignified Persons.</p>

                     <speaker>1. <hi>Woman.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>VVEll, now the Duke of <hi>Inconstancy</hi> hath forsaken our Lady, his <hi>Comical Dutchess,</hi> all our State must down.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>2. <hi>Woman.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Yes, and we must lose our places, in going before others, as being Dutchess's women.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>1. <hi>Woman.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>The Dutchess cryed all night.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <p n="2">2. She had no more reason to cry, than she had, for the matter of Digni|ty; for, pray consider, her Highness may keep the same State, as being Dutchess still, as well as she did before; for she possess'd the Honour no more than she doth now, and so now no less than she did then.</p>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>1. <hi>Woman.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>That is true, but the Duke did help to countenance her State, so long as he did live with her, as a Husband, whereas now she will be hist off the Stage.</p>

                     <p>Faith Confidence, and a Resolution will bear her up, where|fore let us perswade her not to be daunted, or put out of countenance, and she having the same Estate she had, may maintain her self as high as she hath done.</p>

                     <p>That is all one, for did not the Duke of <hi>Inconstancy</hi> marry a Lady, and made her a Dutchess, although he had a Dutchess to his Wife before, by whom he was a Duke.</p>

               <l>In <hi>Chronicle</hi> you'l find a story plain,</l>
               <l>A <hi>Britain</hi> Queen that happily did Raign.</l>
               <l>At last did marry one below her State,</l>
               <l>Which merited not a Crown, or Kinly Fate;</l>
               <l>Fos he, when Power got, did put away</l>
               <l>His Royal Wife; and married, as they say,</l>
               <l>Another Lady; She and he did live</l>
               <l>Like lawfull King and Queen, till God did give</l>
               <l>The ronged Queen, her Kingdom back again;</l>
