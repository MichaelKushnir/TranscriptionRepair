                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>_AT that time when the ſtates of <hi>Greece</hi> began to growe great, and Philoſophie to be thought pretious, <hi>Solon</hi> the firſt light of the Athenian common-wealth like a proui|dent Bee gathering honnie ouer many fields, learning knowledge ouer many countries, was ſent for by <hi>Croeſus</hi> King of <hi>Lidia</hi> as famous for his Wealth, as the other was for his Wiſedome. And not ſo much for any deſire the King had to profit by the experience of ſo profound a Philoſopher, as to haue the report of his (as he thought it) happines approoued by the testimonie of ſo renoumed a witneſſe. But <hi>Solon</hi> always like himſelfe entring the regall Pallace, and ſeeing the ſame very gloriouſly apparelled, but very incommodiouſlie furni|ſhed with Courtiers, more curious to haue their bodies deckt with a woma|niſhlie affected forme of rayment, and ſome ſuperficiall complements of pre|tended curteſies, then to haue their minds enriched with the true treaſure of ineſtimable vertue, he had the ſame altogether in diſdaine. Therefore after ſome conference had with <hi>Croeſus</hi> concerning the felicitie of man, his opinion not ſeconding the Kings expectation, he was returned with con|tempt as one of no vnderstanding. But yet comforted by <hi>Aeſop</hi> (Authour of the wittie fables) who for the time was reſident at Court, and in credit with the King.</p>
                  <p>Immediately after the departure of <hi>Solon, Croeſus</hi> hauing two Sonnes (whereof the eldeſt was dumbe, and the other a braue youth) dreamd that the yongeſt dyed by the wound of a dart, wherewith being maruellouſly troubled, he maried him to a Gentlewoman named <hi>Caelia,</hi> and for farther diſapointing the ſuspected, though ineuitable destinie, he diſcharged the vſing of all ſuch weapons as he had dreamed of. Yet who could cut away the occaſion from the heauens of accompliſhing that which they had de|ſignd. The ſpiritfull youth being long restraind from the fields, was inuited by ſome countrie-men to the chace of a wild Boare, yet could very hardlie impetrate leaue of his louinglie ſuspitious father.</p>
                  <p>Now in the meane time there arriued at <hi>Sardis</hi> a youth named <hi>Adra|ſtus,</hi> Sonne to the King of <hi>Phrigia,</hi> one no leſſe infortunate then valourous,
                     <pb facs="3"/>he hauing loſt his mistreſſe by a great diſaster, and hauing kild his brother by a farre greater, came to <hi>Croeſus,</hi> by whom he was courteouſly enter|taind, and by the instancie of the King, and the instigation of others againſt his owne will, who feared the frowardnes of his infectious fortune, he got the custodie of <hi>Atis</hi> (ſo was the Prince called) whom in time of the ſport thinking to kill the Boare, by a monstrous miſhap he killed. After which diſastrous accident ſtanding aboue the dead corps after the inquirie of the truth being pardoned by <hi>Croeſus,</hi> he puniſhed himſelfe by a violent death. There after, <hi>Croeſus</hi> ſorrowing exceedingly this exceeding misfortune, he was comforted by <hi>Sandanis,</hi> who laboured to diſſwade him from his vnne|ceſſary iourney againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> yet he repoſing on ſuperstitious, and wrong interpreted responſes of deceauing oracles, went againſt <hi>Cyrus,</hi> who hauing defeated his forces in the field, and taken himſelfe in the Citie, tyed him to aſtake to be burned, where by the exclaiming diuers times on the name of <hi>Solon,</hi> mouing the Conquerour to compaſſion, he was ſet at libertie, and lamenting the death of his Sonne, and the loſſe of his Kingdome, makes the Cata|ſtrophe of this preſent Tragedie.</p>
