                        <hi>_GEntlemen,</hi> haue a little patience, they are e'en vpon comming, instantly▪ He that should beginne the Play, Master <hi>Littlewit,</hi> the <hi>Proctor,</hi> has a stitch new falne in his black silk stocking; 'twill be drawn vp ere you can tell twenty. He playes one o'the <hi>Arches,</hi> that dwels about the <hi>Hospitall,</hi> and hee has a very pretty part. But for the whole <hi>Play,</hi> will you ha'the truth on't? (I am looking, lest the <hi>Poet</hi> heare me, or his man, Master <hi>Broome,</hi> behind the Arras) it is like to be a very conceited scuruy one, in plaine English. When't comes to the <hi>Fayre,</hi> once: you were e'en as good goe to <hi>Virginia,</hi> for any thing there is of <hi>Smith-field.</hi> Hee has not hit the humors, he do's not know 'hem; hee has not conuers'd with the <hi>Bartholmew</hi>-birds, as they say; hee has ne're a Sword, and Buckler man in his <hi>Fayre,</hi> nor a little <hi>Dauy,</hi> to take toll o'the Bawds there, as in my time, nor a <hi>Kind-heart,</hi> if any bodies teeth should chance to ake in his <hi>Play.</hi> Nor a Iugler with a wel-educa|ted Ape to come ouer the chaine, for the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and backe againe for the <hi>Prince,</hi> and sit still on his arse for the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine!</hi> None o'these fine sights! Nor has he the Canuas-cut'ithe night, for a Hobby-horse|man to creepe into his she-neighbour, and take his leap,

there! Nothing! No, and some writer (that I know) had had but the penning o' this matter, hee would ha' made you such a <hi>Iig-ajogge</hi> i'the boothes, you should ha' thought an earthquake had beene i'the <hi>Fayre</hi>! But these Master-<hi>Poets,</hi> they will ha' their owne absurd courses; they will be inform'd of nothing! Hee has (<hi>sirreuerence</hi>) kick'd me three, or foure times about the Tyring-house, I thanke him, for but offering to putt in, with my experience. I'le be iudg'd by you, <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> now, but for one conceit of mine! would not a fine Pumpe vpon the Stage ha' done well, for a property now? and a <hi>Punque</hi> set vnder vpon her head, with her Sterne vpward, and ha' beene fous'd by my wity young masters o'the <hi>Innes o' Court</hi>? what thinke you o'this for a shew, now? hee will not heare o'this! I am an Asse! I! and yet I kept the <hi>Stage</hi> in Master <hi>Tarletons</hi> time, I thanke my starres. Ho! and that man had liu'd to haue play'd in <hi>Bartholmew Fayre,</hi> you should ha' seene him ha' come in, and ha' beene coozened i'the Cloath-quarter, so finely! And <hi>Adams,</hi> the Rogue, ha leap'd and caper'd vpon him, and ha' dealt his vermine about, as though they had cost him nothing. And then a substantiall watch to ha' stolne in vpon 'hem, and taken 'hem away, with mistaking words, as the fashion is, in the <hi>Stage</hi>-practice.</p>

And of <hi>Scotland</hi> the seauen and fortieth.</p>
                     <p>INPRIMIS, It is couenanted and agreed, by and be|tweene the parties abouesaid, and the said <hi>Spectators,</hi> and <hi>Hearers,</hi> aswell the curious and enuious, as the fauouring and iudicious, as also the grounded Iudgements and vn|derstandings, doe for themselues seuerally Couenant, and agree to remaine in the places, their money or friends haue put them in, with patience, for the space of two houres and an halfe, and somewhat more. In which time the <hi>Author</hi> promiseth to present them by vs, with a new suf|ficient Play called BARTHOLMEW FAYRE, merry, and as full of noise, as sport: made to delight all, and to offend none. Prouided they haue either, the wit or the honesty to thinke well of themselues.</p>
                     <p>It is further agreed that euery person here, haue his or their free-will of censure, to like or dislike at their owne charge, the <hi>Author</hi> hauing now departed with his right: It shall bee lawfull for any man to iudge his six pen'orth his twelue pen'orth, so to his eighteene pence, 2. shillings, halfe a crowne, to the value of his place: Prouided alwaies his place get not aboue his wit. And if he pay for halfe a
<pb facs="6"/>
dozen, hee may censure for all them too, so that he will vndertake that they shall bee silent. Hee shall put in for <hi>Censures</hi> here, as they doe for <hi>lots</hi> at the <hi>lottery</hi>: mary if he drop but sixe pence at the doore, and will censure a crownes worth, it is thought there is no conscience, or iustice in that.</p>
                     <p>It is also agreed, that euery man heere, exercise his owne Iudgement, and not censure by <hi>Contagion,</hi> or vp|on <hi>trust,</hi> from anothers voice, or face, that sits by him, be he neuer so first, in the <hi>Commission of Wit</hi>: As also, that hee bee fixt and settled in his censure, that what hee approues, or not approues to day, hee will doe the same to morrow, and if to morrow, the next day, and so the next weeke (if neede be:) and not to be brought about by any that sits on the <hi>Bench</hi> with him, though they indite, and arraigne <hi>Playes</hi> daily.

Well, I will forbeare, Sir, but i'faith, would thou wouldst leaue thy exercise of widdow-hunting once! this drawing after an old reuerend Smocke by the splay-foote: There cannot be an ancient <hi>Tripe</hi> or <hi>Trillibub</hi> i'the Towne, but thou art straight nosing it, and 'tis a fine occupation thou'lt confine thy selfe to, when thou ha'st got one; scrubbing a piece of Buffe, as if thou hadst the perpetuity of <hi>Pannyer-alley</hi> to stinke in; or perhaps, worse, currying a carkasse, that thou hast bound thy selfe to aliue. I'll besworne, some of them, (that thou art, or hast beene a Suitor to) are so old, as no chast or marryed pleasure can euer become 'hem: the honest Instrument of procreation, has (forty yeeres since) left to belong to 'hem, thou must visit 'hem, as thou wouldst doe a <hi>Tombe,</hi> with a Torch, or three hand-fulls of Lincke, flaming hot, and so thou maist hap to make 'hem feele thee, and after, come to inherit according to thy inches. A sweet course for a man to waste the brand of life for, to be still ●aking himselfe a fortune in an old womans embers; we shall ha' thee after thou hast beene but a moneth marryed to one of 'hem, looke like the <hi>quartane ague,</hi> and the black <hi>Iaundise</hi> met in a face, and walke as if thou had'st bor|row'd legges of a <hi>Spinner,</hi> and voyce of a <hi>Cricket.</hi> I would endure to heare fifteene Sermons aweeke for her, and such course, and lowd one's, as some of'hem must be; I would een desire of Fate, I might dwell in a drumme, and take in my sustenance, with an old broken Tobacco-pipe and a Straw. Dost thou euer thinke to

bring thine eares or stomack, to the patience of a drie <hi>grace,</hi> as long as thy Tablecloth? and droan'd out by thy sonne, here, (that might be thy father;) till all the meat o'thy board has forgot, it was that day i'the Kitchin? Or to brooke the noise made, in a question of <hi>Predestination,</hi> by the good labourers and painefull eaters, assem|bled together, put to 'hem by the Matron, your Spouse; who mo|derates with a cup of wine, euer and anone, and a Sentence out of <hi>Knoxe</hi> between? or the perpetuall spitting, before, and after a sober drawne <hi>exhortation</hi> of six houres, whose better part was the <hi>hum-ha|hum?</hi> Or to heare prayers groan'd out, ouer thy iron-chests, as if they were <hi>charmes</hi> to breake 'hem? And all this for the hope of two <hi>Apostle</hi>-spoones, to suffer! and a cup to eate a cawdle in! For that will be thy legacy.

                        <p>Verily, for the disease of longing, it is a disease, a carnall disease, or appetite, incident to women: and as it is carnall, and incident, it is naturall, very naturall: Now Pigge, it is a meat, and a meat that is nourishing, and may be long'd for, and so conse|quently eaten; it may be eaten; very exceeding well eaten: but in the <hi>Fayre,</hi> and as a <hi>Bartholmew</hi>-pig, it cannot be eaten, for the very calling it a <hi>Bartholmew</hi>-pigge, and to eat it so, is a spice of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> and you make the <hi>Fayre,</hi> no better then one of the high <hi>Places.</hi> This I take it, is the state of the question.

They may haue seene ma|ny a foole in the habite of a Iustice; but neuer till now, a Iustice in the habit of a foole. Thus must we doe, though, that wake for the publike good: and thus hath the wise Magistrate done in all ages. There is a doing of right out of wrong, if the way be found. Neuer shall I enough commend a worthy worshipfull man, some|time a capitall member of this City, for his high wisdome, in this point, who would take you, now the habit of a Porter; now of a Carman; now of the Dog-killer, in this moneth of <hi>August</hi>; and in the winter, of a Seller of tinder-boxes; and what would hee doe in all these shapes? mary goe you into euery Alehouse, and down in|to euery Celler; measure the length of puddings, take the gage of blacke pots, and cannes, I, and custards with a sticke; and their circumference, with a thrid; weigh the loaues of bread on his middle-finger; then would he send for 'hem, home; giue the pud|dings to the poore, the bread to the hungry, the custards to his children; breake the pots, and burne the cannes, himselfe; hee Would not trust his corrupt officers; he would do't himselfe. would all men in authority would follow this worthy president! For (alas) as we are publike persons, what doe we know? nay, what can wee know? wee heare with other mens eares; wee see with other mens eyes? a foolish Constable, or a sleepy Watch|man,

is all our information, he slanders a Gentleman, by the vertue of his place, (as he calls it) and wee by the vice of ours, must be|leeue him. As a while agone, they made mee, yea me, to mis|take an honest zealous Pursiuant, for a <hi>Seminary</hi>: and a proper yong Batcheler of Musicke, for a Bawd. This wee are subiect to, that liue in high place, all our intelligence is idle, and most of our intelligencers, knaues: and by your leaue, our selues, thought little better, if not errant fooles, for beleeuing 'hem. I <hi>Adam Ouerdoo,</hi> am resolu'd therefore, to spare spy-money hereafter, and make mine owne discoueries.

                        <p>I will make no more orations, shall draw on these tragicall con|clusions. And I begin now to thinke, that by a spice of collate|rall Iustice, <hi>Adam Ouerdoo,</hi> deseru'd this beating; for I the said <hi>Adam,</hi> was one cause (a by-cause) why the purse was lost: and my wiues brothers purse too, which they know not of yet. But I shall make very good mirth with it, at supper, (that will be the sport) and put my little friend, M^r <hi>Humphrey Wasp's</hi> choler quite out of counte|nance. When, sitting at the vpper end o'my Table, as I vse, &amp; drink|ing to my brother <hi>Cokes,</hi> and M^r^s. <hi>Alice Ouerdoo,</hi> as I wil, my wife, for their good affectiō to old <hi>Bradley,</hi> I deliuer to'hem, it was I, that was cudgell'd, and shew 'hem the marks. To see what bad euents may peepe out o'the taile of good purposes! the care I had of that ciuil yong man, I tooke fancy to this morning, (and haue not left it yet) drew me to that exhortation, which drew the company, indeeede, which drew the ●ut-purse; which drew the money; which drew my brother <hi>Cokes</hi> his losse; which drew on <hi>Wasp's</hi> anger; which drew on my beating: a pretty gradation! And they shall ha' it i'their dish, i'faith, at night for fruit: I loue to be merry at my Ta|ble. I had thought once, at one speciall blow he ga'me, to haue re|uealed my selfe? but then (I thank thee fortitude) I remembred that a wise man (and who is euer so great a part, o'the Common-wealth in himselfe) for no particular disaster ought to abandon a publike good designe. The husbandman ought not for one vn|thankful yeer, to forsake the plough; The Shepheard ought not, for one scabb'd sheep, to throw by his tar-boxe; The Pilot ought not for one leake i'the poope, to quit the Helme; Nor the Alderman ought not for one custerd more, at a meale, to giue vp his cloake; The Constable ought not to breake his staffe, and forsweare the watch, for one roaring night; Nor the Piper o'the Parish (<hi>Vt par|uis componere magna solebam</hi>) to put vp his pipes, for one rainy Sunday. These are certaine knocking conclusions; out of which, I am resolu'd, come what come can, come beating, come imprison|ment, come infamy, come banishment, nay, come the rack, come the hurdle, (welcome all) I will not discouer who I am, till my due time; and yet still, all shall be, as I said euer, in Iustice name, and the King's, and for the Common-wealth.</p>

I am sorry I employ'd this fellow; for he thinks me such: <hi>Fa|cinus quos inquinat, aequat.</hi> But, it was for sport. And would I make it serious, the getting of this Licence is nothing to me, without o|ther circumstances concurre. I do thinke how impertinently I la|bour, if the word bee not mine, that the ragged fellow mark'd: And what aduantage I haue giuen <hi>Ned Win-wife</hi> in this time now, of working her, though it be mine. Hee'll go neare to forme to her what a debauch'd Rascall I am, and fright her out of all good con|ceipt of me: I should doe so by him, I am sure, if I had the oppor|tunity. But my hope is in her temper, yet; and it must needs bee next to despaire, that is grounded on any part of a woman's dis|cretion.

Good Sir, heare mee, I am worth sixe thousand pound, my loue to you, is become my racke, I'll tell you all, and the truth: since you hate the hyporisie of the party-coloured brother-hood. These seuen yeeres, I haue beene a wilfull holy widdow, onely to draw feasts, and gifts from my in|tangled suitors: I am also by office, an assisting <hi>sister</hi> of the <hi>Deacons,</hi> and a deuourer, in stead of a distributer of the alms. I am a speciall maker of marriages for our decayed <hi>Brethren,</hi> with our rich <hi>wid|dowes</hi>; for a third part of their wealth, when they are marryed, for the reliefe of the poore <hi>elect:</hi> as also our poore handsome yong Virgins, with our wealthy Batchelors, or Widdowers; to make them steale from their husbands, when I haue confirmed them in the faith, and got all put into their custodies. And if I ha' not my bargaine, they may sooner turne a scolding drab, in to a silent <hi>Minister,</hi> then make me leaue pronouncing <hi>reprobation,</hi> and <hi>damna|tion</hi> vnto them. Our elder, <hi>Zeale-of-the-land,</hi> would haue had me, but I know him to be the capitall Knaue of the land, making him|selfe rich, by being made <hi>Feoffee</hi> in trust to deceased <hi>Brethren,</hi> and coozning their <hi>heyres,</hi> by swearing the absolute gift of their inhe|ritance. And thus hauing eas'd my conscience, and vtter'd my heart, with the tongue of my loue: enioy all my deceits together. I beseech you. I should not haue reuealed this to you, but that in time I thinke you are mad, and I hope you'll thinke mee so too, Sir?</p>
