                        <l>Of man, his strength, or rea|son, but his loue.</l>
                        <l>And not in vaine: Since <hi>loue,</hi> of all the powres,</l>
                        <l>Is it which gouernes euery thought of ours.</l>
                        <l>I speake by <hi>Mustapha:</hi> For as a Father,</l>
                        <l>How often deem'd I those light-iudging praises</l>
                        <l>Of multitudes, whom my loue taught to flatter,</l>
                        <l>Truths oracles; and <hi>Mustapha's</hi> true stories?</l>
                        <l>So dearely Nature bidds our owne be lou'd:</l>
                        <l>So ill a Iudge is loue of things belou'd.</l>
                        <l>But is contempt the fruit of Parents care?</l>
                        <l>Doth kindnesse lessen Kings authority,</l>
                        <l>Teaching our Children pride, our Vassalls wit,</l>
                        <l>To subiect vs, that subiect are to it?</l>
                        <l>This frailty in my selfe I conquer must,</l>
                        <l>And stay the false vntimely hopes it workes,</l>
                        <l>Threatning the Fathers ruine in the Sonne:</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Many with trust, with doubt few are vndone.</hi>

                        <l>To <hi>Mustapha,</hi> made me (poore silly woman)</l>
                        <l>Thinke worth in blood had naturall succession:</l>

                        <l>The gold of Natures elements allay.</l>
                        <l>His Fame vntimely borne: Strength strangely gather'd,</l>
                        <l>Honnor wonne with honoring, Greatnesse with humble|nesse,</l>
                        <l>(A Monarchs heire in courses popular,)</l>
                        <l>Make me diuine some strange aspiring minde;</l>
                        <l>Yet doubtfull; for it might be Art, or Kinde.</l>
                        <l>But looke into him by his outward wayes:</l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Persia,</hi> our old imbrued enemy,</l>
                        <l>Treats of peace with the Sonne, without the Father:</l>
                        <l>A Course in all Estates to Princes nice;</l>
                        <l>But here much more; where he that <hi>Monarch</hi> is,</l>
                        <l>Must (like the Sunne) haue no light shine, but his.</l>
                        <l>The Offers; reall Crownes, or hopes of Kingdomes.</l>
                        <l>What suddaine knot hath bound vp our diuisions?</l>
                        <l>Made them that only fear'd our greater growing,</l>
                        <l>Offer such proiects for our greater growing?</l>
                        <l>" 'Tis true, that priuate thoughts may easily change:</l>
                        <l>" But States, whose wayes are Time; Occasion, Seate,</l>
                        <l>" Hane other ends, then Chance, in all they treat.</l>
                        <l>Yet be it, all the world would vs obey;</l>
                        <l>In Monarchies: which surfet, more than pine;</l>
                        <l>The King should iudge: <hi>Strength knowes what strength can weld:</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>The best foundation, else may ouer-build.</l>
                        <l>No, no: vpon the pitch of high attemps</l>
                        <l>I see him stand, sporting with Wrong, and Feare:</l>
                        <l>For Law, and Duty, both are captiues there.</l>
                        <l>His hopes, the hopes of all; for all aspire:</l>
                        <l>His meanes, that proud, rebellious Discontent,</l>

                        <l>I could say; I take pride in thine affection:</l>
