            <head>THE MASKE OF
THE INNER TEMPLE AND
GRAYES INNE, GRAYES INNE
and the Inner Temple, presented before his
Maiestie, the Queenes, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>_THis Maske was appointed
to haue beene presented
the Shroue-tuesday before,
at which time the Mas|kers
with their attendants
and diuers others gallant
young Gentlemen of both houses, as their
conuoy, set forth from Winchester house
which was the <hi>Rende vous</hi> towards the
Court, about seuen of the clocke at night.</p>
            <p>This voyage by water was performed in
great Triumph. The gentlemen Maskers be|ing
placed by themselues in the Kings royall
barge with the rich furniture of state, and a|dorned
with a great number of lights placed
<pb facs="3"/>
in such order as might make best shew.</p>
            <p>They were attended with a multitude of
barges and gallies, with all variety of lowde
Musicke, and seuerall peales, of Ordnance.
And led by two Admiralls.</p>
            <p>Of this shew his Maiesty was gratiously
pleased to take view, with the Prince, the
Count <hi>Palatine,</hi> and the Lady <hi>Elizabeth:</hi>
their highnesses at the windowes of his priuy
gallerie vpon the water, till their landing,
which was at the priuy staires; where they
were most honorablie receiued by the Lord
Chamberlaine, and so conducted to the
Vestry.</p>
            <p>The Hall was by that time filled with com|pany
of very good fashion, but yet so as a ve|ry
great number of principall Ladies, and o|ther
noble persons were not yet come in,
wherby it was foreseen that the roome would
be so scanted as might haue been inconueni|ent.
And there vpon his Maiesty was most
gratiously pleased with the consent of the
gentlemen Maskers, to put off the night vntil
Saturday following with this special fauour
and priuiledge, that there should bee no let,
<pb facs="3"/>
as to the outward ceremony of magnificence
vntill that time.</p>
            <p>At the day that it was presented, there was
a choice roome reserued for the gentlemen,
of both their houses, who comming in
troope about seuen of the clocke, receiued
that speciall honor and noble fauour, as to
be brought to their places, by the
Right Honourable the Earle of
Northampton, Lord Pri|uie
Seale.</p>

Inne, and the Inner Temple, the Inner
Temple, and Grayes Inne.</head>
            <p>_YEe that spared no time nor trauell, in the
setting forth, ordering, &amp; furnishing of
this Masque, being the first fruits of ho|nor

haue offered to his Maiestie: VVill not thinke
much now to looke backe vpon the effects of your
owne care and worke: for that whereof the successe
was then doubtfull, is now happily performed and
gratiously accepted. And that which you were then
to thinke of in straites of time, you may now peruse
at leysure: And you <hi>Sir Francis Bacon</hi> especially,
as you did then by your countenance, and louing
affection aduance it, so let your good word grace it,
and defend it, which is able to adde value to the

ARGVMENT OF THE
MASQVE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>_IVpiter</hi> and <hi>Iuno</hi> willing to doe
honour to the Mariage of the
two famous Riuers <hi>Thamesis</hi>
and <hi>Rhone,</hi> imploy their Mes|sengers
seuerally, <hi>Mercurie</hi> and
<hi>Iris</hi> for that purpose. They meete and con|tend:
then <hi>Mercurie</hi> for his part brings forth
an Anti-masque all of Spirits or diuine Na|tures;
but yet not of one kinde or liuerie (be|cause
that had been so much in vse hereto|fore)
but as it were in consort like to broken
Musicke: And preseruing the proprietie of
the deuise; for that Riuers in nature are
maintained either by Springs from beneath,
or Shewers from aboue: He raiseth foure of
the <hi>Naiades</hi> out of the Fountaines, and brin|geth
<pb facs="6"/>
downe fiue of the <hi>Hyades</hi> out of the
Cloudes to daunce‚óè hereupon <hi>Iris</hi> scoffes at
<hi>Mercurie</hi> for that hee had deuised a daunce
but of one Sexe, which could haue no life: but
<hi>Mercurie</hi> who was prouided for that excep|tion,
and in token that the Match should be
blessed both with Loue and Riches calleth
forth out of the Groues foure <hi>Cupids,</hi> and
brings downe from <hi>Iupiters</hi> Altar foure
<hi>Statuaes</hi> of gold and siluer to daunce with the
Nymphes and Starres: in which daunce the
<hi>Cupids</hi> being blinde, and the <hi>Statuaes</hi> hauing
but halfe life put into them, and retaining still
somewhat of their old nature, giueth fit oc|casion
to new and strange varieties both in
the Musick and paces. This was the first An|ti-masque.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Iris</hi> for her part in scorne of this
high-flying deuise, and in token that the
Match shall likewise be blessed with the loue
of the Common People, calles to <hi>Flora</hi> her
confederate (for that the Moneths of flowers
are likewise the Moneths of sweete shewers,
and Raine bowes) to bring in a May daunce
or Rurall daunce, consisting likewise not of
<pb facs="6"/>
any suted persons, but of a confusion or com|mixture
of all such persons as are naturall
and proper for Countrey sports. This is the
second Anti-masque.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Mercurie</hi> and <hi>Iris</hi> after this vying
one vpon the other, seeme to leaue their con|tention;
and <hi>Mercurie</hi> by the consent of <hi>Iris</hi>
brings downe the <hi>Olympian</hi> Knights, intima|ting
that <hi>Iupiter</hi> hauing after a long discon|tinuance
reuiued the <hi>Olympian</hi> games, and
summoned thereunto from all parts the liue|liest
&amp; actiuest persons that were had enioy|ned
them before they fell to their games to
doe honour to these Nuptials. The <hi>Olympian</hi>
games portend to the Match, Celebritie,
Victorie, and Felicitie. This was the maine
Masque.</p>
            <p>The Fabricke was a Mountaine with two
descents, and seuered with two Trauesses.</p>

life, with diuers boscages and Grouets vpon
the steepe or hanging grounds thereof; and
at the foote of the Hill, foure delicate Foun|taines
running with water and bordered with
sedges and water flowers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iris</hi> first appeared; and presently after
