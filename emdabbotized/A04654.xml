            <p>_IT is a noble and iust advan|tage,
that the things subje|cted
to <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> have
of those which are objec|ted
to <hi>Sense,</hi> that the one
sorte are but momentarie,
and meerely taking; the
other impressing, and la|sting:
Else the Glory of all these <hi>Solemnities</hi> had
perish'd like a Blaze, and gone out, in the <hi>Be|holders</hi>
eyes. So short-liv'd are the <hi>Bodies</hi> of all
Thinges, in comparison of their <hi>Soules.</hi> And,
though <hi>Bodies</hi> oft-times have the ill lucke to be
sensually preferr'd, they find afterwards, the good
fortune (when <hi>Soules</hi> live) to be vtterly forgotten.
This it is hath made the most royall <hi>Princes,</hi> and
greatest <hi>Persons,</hi> (who are commonly the <hi>Persona|ters</hi>
of these <hi>Actions)</hi> not onely studious of Riches,
and Magnificence in the outward Celebration, or
Shew; (which rightly becomes them) but curi|ous
after the most high, and hearty <hi>Inventions,</hi> to
furnish the inward parts: (and those grounded vp|on
<hi>Antiquitie,</hi> and solide <hi>Learnings)</hi> which, though
their <hi>Voyce</hi> be taught to sound to present Occasi|ons,
their <hi>Sense,</hi> or dooth, or should alwayes lay
holde on more remov'd <hi>Mysteries.</hi> And, howsoe|ver
some may squeamishly cry out, that all Ende|vor
of <hi>Learning,</hi> and <hi>Sharpnesse</hi> in these transitory
<pb facs="3"/>
               <hi>Devises</hi> especially, where it steppes beyond their
little, or (let me not wrong 'hem) no Braine at all
is superfluous; I am contented, these fastidious
<hi>Stomachs</hi> should leave my full Tables, and enioy
at home, their cleane empty Trenchers, fittest for
such airy Tasts: where perhaps a few <hi>Italian</hi> Herbs,
pick'd vp, &amp; made into a <hi>Sallade,</hi> may find sweeter
acceptance, than al, the most norishing, and sound
Meates of the world.</p>
            <p>For these Mens palates, let not mee answere, O
<hi>Muses.</hi> It is not my fault, if I fill them out <hi>Nectar,</hi>
and they runne to <hi>Metheglin.</hi>

            <p>HItherto extended the first Nights <hi>Solemnitie,</hi>
whose Grace in the Exequution left not
where to adde vnto it, with wishing: I meane,
(nor doe I court them) in those, that sustain'd the
<hi>Nobler</hi> parts. Such was the exquisit Performance,
as (beside the <hi>Pompe, Splendour,</hi> or what wee may
<pb facs="17"/>
call <hi>Apparrelling</hi> of such <hi>Presentments</hi>) that alone
(had all else beene absent) was of power to sur|prize
with Delight, and steale away the <hi>Spectators</hi>
from themselves. Nor was there wanting what|soever
might give to the Furniture, or <hi>Comple|ment:</hi>
eyther in riches, or strangenesse of the <hi>Ha|bites,</hi>
delicacie of <hi>Daunces,</hi> Magnificence of the
<hi>Scene,</hi> or divine Rapture of <hi>Musique.</hi> Onely the
Envie was, that it lasted not still, or (now it is past)
cannot by Imagination, much lesse Description,
be recover'd to a part of that <hi>Spirit,</hi> it had in the
gliding by.</p>
            <p>Yet, that I may not vtterly defraud the <hi>Reader</hi>
of his Hope, I am drawne to give it those briefe
touches, which may leave behind some shadow of
what it was: And first of the <hi>Attires.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That, of the Lords, had parte of it (for the fa|shion)
taken from the <hi>Antique Greeke</hi> Statue; mix|ed
with some <hi>Moderne</hi> Additions: which made
it both gracefull, and strange. On their Heades
they wore <hi>Persick</hi> Crowns, that were with Scroles
of <hi>Gold-plate</hi> turn'd outward; and wreath'd about
with a <hi>Carnation</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> Net-lawne: The one
End of which hung carelesly on the left shoulder,
the other was trick'd vp before in severall degrees
of fouldes, betweene the Plates, and set with rich
Iewelles, and great Pearle. Their Bodies were of
<hi>Carnation</hi> cloth of silver, richly wrought, and cut
to expresse the <hi>Naked,</hi> in maner of the <hi>Greeke Tho|rax;</hi>
girt vnder the Breasts, with a broade <hi>Belt</hi> of
Cloth of Golde, imbrodered, and fastned before
<pb facs="17"/>
with Iewells: Their Labells were of <hi>White</hi> Cloth
of silver, lac'd, and wrought curiously betweene,
sutable to the vpper halfe of their Sleeves; whose
nether partes, with their Bases, were of <hi>Watchet</hi>
Cloth of Silver, chev'rond all over with Lace.
Their Mantills were of severall colour'd silkes, di|stinguishing
their Qualities, as they were coupled
in payres; The first, <hi>Skie colour;</hi> The second, <hi>Pearle
colour;</hi> The third, <hi>Flame colour;</hi> The fourth, <hi>Taw|nie;</hi>
And these cut in leaves, which were subtilly
tack'd vp, and imbrodered with <hi>Oo's,</hi> and between
every ranke of Leaves, a broad silver Lace. They
were fastned on the right shoulder, and fell Com|passe
downe the backe in gratious folds, and were
againe tied with a round Knot, to the fastning of
their Swords. Vpon their legges they wore <hi>Silver</hi>
Greaves, answering in worke to their Labells; and
these were their <hi>Accoutrements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Ladies <hi>Attire</hi> was wholy new, for the In|vention,
and full of Glory; as having in it the most
true impression of a <hi>Celestiall</hi> Figure: The vpper
part of <hi>White</hi> Cloth of Silver, wrought with IV|NOES
<hi>Birdes</hi> and <hi>Fruicts;</hi> A loose vnder garment,
full-gather'd, of <hi>Carnation,</hi> strip't with <hi>Silver,</hi> and
parted with a Golden <hi>Zone;</hi> Beneath that, an o|ther
flowing Garment, of <hi>Watchet</hi> Cloth of Sil|ver,
lac'd with Gold: Through all which, though
they were round, and swelling, there yet appear'd
some touch of their delicate <hi>Lineaments,</hi> preserving
the sweetenesse of <hi>Proportion,</hi> and expressing it
selfe beyond expression. The <hi>Attire</hi> of their Heads,
<pb facs="18"/>
did answer, if not exceede; their Hayre being care|lesly
(but yet with more art, then if more affected)
bound vnder the circle of a rare, and rich <hi>Coronet,</hi>
adorn'd with all variety, and choyce of Iewells;
from the top of which, flow'd a trasparent <hi>Veile</hi>
downe to the ground; whose verge, returning
vp, was fastned to eyther side in most sprightly
Manner. Their shooes were <hi>Azure,</hi> and Gold, set
with Rubies, and Diamonds; so were all their
Garments: and euery part abounding in Orna|ment.</p>
            <p>No lesse to be admir'd, for the Grace, and
Greatnesse, was the whole <hi>Machine</hi> of the <hi>Specta|cle,</hi>
from whence they came: the first part of which
was a <seg xml:lang="unk">〈◊〉 〈◊〉〈◊〉</seg>, or <hi>Globe,</hi> filld with <hi>Coun|treys,</hi>
and those guilded; where the <hi>Sea</hi> was ●x|prest,
heightned with siluer waues. This stoode,
or rather hung, (for no <hi>Axell</hi> was seene to sup|port
it) and turning softly, discoverd the first
<hi>Masque,</hi> (as we have before, but too runningly
declar'd) which was of the <hi>Men,</hi> sitting in faire
<hi>Composition,</hi> within a <hi>Mine</hi> of severall Mettalls: To
which, the Lights were so plac'd, as noe one was
seene; but seemed, as if onel● REASON, with the
splendor of her Crowne, illumin'd the whole
Grot.</p>
            <p>On the sides of this (which began the other
part) were placed two great <hi>Statues,</hi> fayn'd of
Gold, one of <hi>Atlas,</hi> the other of <hi>Hercules,</hi> in varied
postures, bearing vp the Cloudes, which were of
<hi>Releue,</hi> embossed, and tralucent, as Naturalls: To
<pb facs="18"/>
these, a Cortine of painted Cloudes ioyned,
which reach'd to the vpmost Roofe of the Hall;
and sodainely opening, reveal'd the three <hi>Regions</hi>
of <hi>Ayre:</hi> In the highest of which, sate IVNO, in a
glorious Throne of Gold, circled with <hi>Comets,</hi> and
fiery <hi>Meteors,</hi> engendred in that hot and dry <hi>Regi|on;</hi>
her Feete reaching to the lowest, where was
made a <hi>Rainebow,</hi> and within it, <hi>Musitians</hi> seated,
figuring <hi>Ayry</hi> Spirits, their habits various, and re|sembling
the seuerall colours, caused in that part
of the <hi>Ayre</hi> by reflexion. The midst was all of darke
and condensed Cloudes, as being the proper
Place where <hi>Rayne, Hayle,</hi> and other watry <hi>Mete|ors</hi>
are made; out of which two concave Clouds,
from the rest, thrust forth themselves (in nature
of those <hi>Nimbi,</hi> wherein, by <hi>Homer, Virgill,</hi> &amp;c. the
<hi>Gods</hi> are fain'd to descend) and these carried the
eight <hi>Ladies,</hi> over the heads of the two<note n="a" place="marg" anchored="true">
                  <hi>Atlas,</hi> and <hi>Hercules,</hi> the● Figures men|tioned before.</note>
               <hi>Termes;</hi>
who (as the Ingine mov'd) seem'd also to bow
themselves (by vertue of their shadowes) and dis|charge
their shoulders of their glorious burden:
when, having set them on the Earth, both they,
and the Cloudes gather'd themselves vp againe,
with some rapture of the <hi>Beholders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that, which (as above in place, so in the beu|ty)
was most taking in the <hi>Spectacle,</hi> was the <hi>Spheare</hi>
of <hi>Fire;</hi> in the top of all, encompassing the <hi>Ayre,</hi>
and imitated with such art, and industry, as the
<hi>Spectators</hi> might discerne the Motion (all the time
the <hi>Shewes</hi> lasted) without any Moover: and, that
so swift, as no Eye could distinguish any Colour
<pb facs="19"/>
of the Light, but might forme to it selfe five hun|dred
severall hewes, out of the tralucent Body of
the <hi>Ayre,</hi> obiected betwixt it, and them.</p>
            <p>And this was crown'd with a statue of IVPITER,
the <hi>Thunderer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Designe,</hi> and <hi>Act</hi> of all which, together with
the <hi>Device</hi> of their <hi>Habits,</hi> belongs properly to the
Merit, and Reputation of Maister YNYGO IONES;
whom I take modest occasion, in this fit place, to
remember, lest his owne worth might accuse
mee of an ignorant neglect from my silence.</p>
            <p>And here, that no mans Deservings complain of
iniustice (though I should have done it timelier, I
acknowledge) I doe for honours sake, and the
pledge of our Friendship, name Ma. ALPHONSO
FERABOSCO, a Man, planted by himselfe, in that
divine <hi>Spheare;</hi> &amp; mastring all the spirits of <hi>Musique:</hi>
To whose iudiciall Care, and as absolute Perfor|mance,
were committed all those Difficulties both
of <hi>Song,</hi> and otherwise. Wherein, what his Merit
made to the <hi>Soule</hi> of our <hi>Invention,</hi> would aske to
be exprest in Tunes, no lesse ravishing then his.
<hi>V●rtuous</hi> friend, take well this abrupt testimonie,
and thinke whose it is: It cannot be Flatterie, in
me, who never did it to <hi>Great ones;</hi> and lesse then
Love, and Truth it is not, where it is done out of
<hi>Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Daunces were both made, and taught by
Maister THOMAS GILES; and cannot bee more
approv'd, then they did themselves: Nor doe I
want the will, but the skill to commend such <hi>Sub|tilties;</hi>
               <pb facs="19"/>
of which the <hi>Spheare,</hi> wherein they were
acted, is best able to iudge.</p>
            <p>What was my part, the Faults here, as well as
the Vertues must speake.

            <p>ON the next Night, whose <hi>Solemnitie</hi> was of
<hi>Barriers,</hi> (all mention of the former, being vt|terly
remo'vd, and taken away) there appeared, at
the lower end of the <hi>Hall,</hi> a Mist made of delicate
perfumes; out of which (a Battaile being sounded
vnder the Stage) did seeme to breake foorth two
<hi>Ladies,</hi> the one representing TRVTH, the other
OPINION: but both so alike attired, as they could
by no Note, be distinguish'd. The colour of their
Garments were blew, their Socks White; They
were crowned with wreathes of Palme, and in
their hands, each of them sustain'd a Palm-bough.
These, after the Mist was vanished, began to exa|mine
each other curiously with their eyes, and ap|proching
the State, the one expostulated the o|ther
in this manner.</p>
