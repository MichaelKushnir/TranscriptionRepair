                     <p>Sir <hi>Henry,</hi> by reason my Lady is gone abroad, I make bold to visit you.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sage.</speaker>
                     <p>I perceive I am oblig'd to my Wifes absence for your Visit, Madam.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Procurer.</speaker>
                     <p>'Faith, to tell you the truth, we women had ra|ther visit men when they are alone, than when they have company.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sage.</speaker>
                     <p>Then men and women agree better with particular, than with the general.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Procurer.</speaker>
                     <p>They do so, yet they love varietyes best.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sage.</speaker>
                     <p>That's natural, for the Senses to delight in variety.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Procurer.</speaker>
                     <p>It is so, and yet our Civil and Divine Laws have forbid the use of Varieties, which (me thinks) is very unconscionable and unnatural.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sage.</speaker>
                     <p>But if some of the natural Appetites and Actions were not restrain'd by Laws, no Comman-wealth could subsist.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Procurer.</speaker>
                     <p>How did the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> subsist? they liv'd all in common; and had not all <hi>Greece</hi> been imbroyl'd with VVars, their Common-wealth might have lasted to this day.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sage.</speaker>
                     <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had stricter Lawes than the Common-wealth which we live in, and are of: for though they gave more liberty and free|dom to some Actions than our Governments do, yet they were stricter in o|thers; and breakers of their Lawes were more severely punish'd, even in the smallest breach, than the breakers of our Laws are almost in the greatest breach.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Procurer.</speaker>
                     <p>I am sure the Maker of the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> Laws was a wise man,
<pb n="459" facs="241"/>
and a kind-hearted man, in Decreeing for the Increase of Mankino, yet by some of his Laws he seem'd but a Sloven: for he banish'd all curidsity and neatness, and I believe, many conveniences: Also he seem'd to be a man of a weak stomach,</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sage.</speaker>
                     <p>He rather seem'd of a strong stomach, and a greedy appetite, by the course diet he brought men to live with; but (for my part) If I should judge of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> Laws, I should judge that they strove to bring men to be like beasts, rather than to make them like as Gods, which men should strive to be.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Procurer.</speaker>
                     <p>By your favour Sir, there can be no Law that can keep men from being horned beasts.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sage.</speaker>
                     <p>Whose fault is that, Madam? not mens which make the Laws, but womens that break the Laws.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Procurer.</speaker>
                     <p>It is mens fault, for giving women such liberty: And let me tell you Sir, women are such subtil creatures, as they strive first to get an honou|rable esteem from their Friends and Husbands, and a belief of their Cha|stity; and when they have secured mens jealousies, they make their Hus|bands Cuckolds, which all their Neighbours perceive, although the Husband is blind and muffl'd with affection.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sage.</speaker>
                     <p>Madam, your Sex deserve a better Character than you give of them: for by your description there are few chaste.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Procurer.</speaker>
                     <p>Every woman knows the humours of her own Sex better than men know the humours of one another: wherefore let me advise you, Sir <hi>Henry Sage,</hi> to watch my Lady your Wife: for many, to my knowledge, seek for to corrupt her.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sage.</speaker>
                     <p>Madam, although she is one of your Sex, yet she is of an Angelical nature, and not corruptible.</p>

                     <speaker>Sage.</speaker>
                     <p>I have no jealous doubt, Madam.</p>

                     <p>'Tis strange to hear you say so, when but yesterday you made me such protestations of your Faith, believing I was Virtuous, Chaste, and full of Truth, which I did think Time had not power to alter your belief, and such Vows and Protestations of your Affections to me, as if the fire of Love within your heart did burn so clear, and flame so high, as nought could quench it out but Death's cold damps, yet not so much, but still a heat with|in the ashes would remain.</p>

                     <speaker>Sage.</speaker>
                     <p>I confess, VVife, my doubts of Love did make me to try, at least to say so to you.</p>

                     <speaker>Chastity.</speaker>
                     <p>True Love never makes doubts; and though you can dissemble with me, I cannot dissemble with you, could the Gods command me, as they cannot, things unjust.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <p>No truly Husband, I am rather griev'd than angry, to think my honest truth mistrusted: for Doubts are unjust to great Affections, true Love, and good Intentions; and Examinations are scandalous to a strict chaste life, and makes it seem as criminal: but could the VVorld lay fals|hood to your charge, and should condemn you, yet my Affections would set you free, and rather tax my self for want of Merit to deserve your Love, than you want love to give Desert.</p>

                     <p>By all their actions: for beasts (for the most part) are more indu|strious, prudent, temperate, and peaceable, than the best of men; neither do they trouble their heads, nor break their sleeps, about the trifles of the World, but govern their Affairs easily, and live orderly, every several kind agreeing amongst themselves; besides, we are taught to imitate the Ser|pent and the Dove, and Examples are Principles, and the Original is to be preferr'd before the Copy, the Sample before the Pattern. Thus a Beast is preferr'd before a Wise man, by reason all Men must learn of Beasts to be wise, and of Birds to be virtuously honest, as to be harmless.</p>

                     <speaker>Ioan.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes; but there are great differences betwixt Natures: for mankind requires more food than some kind of beasts or birds; for a man would be starv'd, if he should eat no more than a Dormouse, or a Camelion, or a Sparrow.</p>

                     <speaker>Hypocon.</speaker>
                     <p>But a Sparrow cannot eat so much as an Eagle, nor an Eagle so much as an Estrich: Likewise, as it is with Bird-kind, so it is with Man|kind, some would starve with that proportion another would surfet on.</p>

                     <p>But surely there are none that could surfet with your diet, as with Water and Air, nay (most commonly) nothing but Air, Camelion-like: for you oft times for a week together neither eat bit, nor drink a drop; and that which makes me wonder more, is, that you naturally have a very good sto|mach, and can eat, when you please, very heartily, and it thrives well with you; but my greater wonder is, that when you do fast, eating now and then a bit, week after week, nay moneth after moneth, yet you are not so lean, as to appear a Skeleton, nor so weak, but you can walk two hours without re|sting, or being very weary.</p>

                     <p>Alas Husband, consider it is a timorous effect of Love, which is to be pardon'd, since it proceeds from the kindness I have to my Friends; it is honourable to the World, and no dishonour to you, but only trouble|some to my self, and to those I naturally love, as Husband, Children, Father, Mother, Brothers, and Sisters: And though fond Love and vain Fears may be produced from the melancholy Spleen, yet those fears that proceed from my firm, true, and honest Affection, are created in the Soul: for noble, and honourable, and honest Fears, are the natural Issues of pure Love.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lovewel.</speaker>
                     <p>But Reason, the chief Magistrate of the Soul, and Governour of the Passions, should temper the Excess.</p>

                     <speaker>Hypocon.</speaker>
                     <p>O Husband, when Love comes to be temper'd, it loses or quit● the essential part, and the vertical strength: for true Love is pure like gold, which is debased with an allay.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lovewel.</speaker>

                     <p>No faith, those that would be happily match'd, must choose a Hus|band, or VVife by the Ear, and not by the Eye: for though report is oft-times false, yet it seldom flatters; nay for the most part, it is so far from gi|ving merit its due Praises, as it detracts therefrom.</p>

                     <p>'Tis true, hopes of gain are bribes, and fear of punishments are threats, for to perswade, or force the tongue to flatter; yet none but Gods and Kings, are subject to this flattery, and you are not to marry, either the one, nor yet the other; for Gods joyn not to Mortals, and Kings are far too proud to marry Subjects; nor were it good for you, if that they would, as that you were matcht to a King: for happiness lives in equallity.</p>
