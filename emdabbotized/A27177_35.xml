                           <p>Why, that is the very motive of motives: why I ought and will know thee: and if I had not wound thee up to this promiſe, I would not have known thee theſe fifteen yeers, no more then the erranteſt or moſt fou●derd Caſtillian that followed our new Q▪ carriages afoot.</p>

                           <p>That ſhall I, Seignior <hi>Rinaldo:</hi> but would you had come ſooner: you ſee how full the Scaffolds are, there is ſcant room for a Lovers thought here. Gentlewomen, ſit cloſe for ſhame: Has none of ye a little corner for this Gentleman? I'll place ye, fear not. And how did our brave King of Portugal, <hi>Emanuel,</hi> bear himſelf to day? You ſaw the ſolemnitie of the marriage.</p>
                        </sp>
                        <sp>
                           <speaker>Rin.</speaker>
                           <p>Why, like a fit Husband for ſo gracious and ex|cellent a Princeſſe, as his worthie mate <hi>Iſabella,</hi> the King of Caſtiles Daughter doth in her very external lineaments, mixture of colours, and joyning Dove-like behaviour aſſure her ſelf to be. And I proteſt (my deer Don) ſeri|ouſly, I can ſing prophetically nothing but bleſſed hymns, and happie occaſions to this ſacred union of <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Caſtile,</hi> which have ſo wiſely and mutually conjoyned two ſuch vertuous and beautifull Princes as theſe are; and in all opinion like to multiplie to their very laſt minute.</p>

                           <p>The King is entring: Seignior hover here about, and as ſoon as the Train is ſet, clap into me, wee'll ſtand neer the State. If you have any Creditors here, they ſhall renew bonds a Twelvemonth on ſuch a ſight: but to to touch the pomell of the Kings chair in the ſight of a Citizen, is better ſecurity for 10 0 double duckets, then three of the beſt Merchants in Lisbon. Beſides, Seignior, wee will cenſure not onely the King in the Play here, that reigns his two hours; but the King himſelf, that is to rule his life time: Take my counſell: I have one word to ſay to this noble aſſembly, and I am for you.</p>
