            <p>
               <hi>_WOrld,</hi> I was ●nce resolu'd to bee round with thee,
because of know tis thy fashion to bee round with
euery bodie: but the winde shifting his point, the
Veine turn'd: yet because thou wilt sit as Iudge
of all matters (though for thy labour thou wear'st
<hi>Midasses</hi> eares, and ar●<hi>Monstrum horren|dum,
informe: Ingens cui lumen ademptum;</hi> whose great <hi>Po|liphemian</hi>
eye is put out) I care not much if I make description (be|fore
thy <hi>Vniuersality)</hi> of that terrible <hi>Poetomachi●,</hi> lately com|menc'd
betweene <hi>Horace the second,</hi> and a band of leane-witted
<hi>Poetasters.</hi> They haue bin at high wordes, and so high, that the
ground could not serue them, but (for want of <hi>Chopins</hi>) haue stalk'●
vpon Stages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Horace</hi> hal'd his <hi>Poetasters</hi> to the Barre, the <hi>Poetasters</hi> vn|truss'd
<hi>Horace:</hi> how worthily eyther, or how wrongfully, <hi>(World)</hi>
leaue it to the Iurie: <hi>Horace</hi> (questionles) made himselfe beleeue,
that his <hi>Burgonian</hi> wit might desperately challenge all commers,
and that none durst take vp the foyles against him: It's likely, if he
had not so bel●iu'd, he had not bin so deceiu'd, for hee was answer'd
at his 〈◊〉 weapon: And if before <hi>Apollo</hi> himselfe (who is <hi>Coro|nator
Poetarum)</hi> an <hi>Inquisition</hi> should be taken touching this la|●entable
〈◊〉 murdering of Innocent Poetry: all mount <hi>Helicon</hi>

            <p>I could heere (〈◊〉 with the feather of my pen) wipe off other ri|diculous
imputations: but my best way to answer them, is to laugh
at them: onely thus much I protest (and sweare by the diuinest part
of true Poesie) that (howsoeuer the limmes of my naked lines may bee
and I know haue haue bin, tortur'd on the racke) they are free from
conspiring the least disgrace to any man, but onely to our new <hi>Ho|race;</hi>
neyther should this ghost of <hi>Tucca,</hi> haue walkt vp and downe
Poules Church-yard, but that hee was raiz'd vp (in print) by newe
<hi>Exorcismes. World,</hi> if thy <hi>Hugenes</hi> will beleiue this: doe, if not,
I care not: for I dedicate my booke not to thy <hi>Greatnes,</hi> but to the
<hi>Greatnes of thy scorne:</hi> Defying which, let that mad Dog <hi>De|traction</hi>
               <pb facs="4"/>
bite till his teeth bee worne to the stumps: <hi>Enuy</hi> feede thy
Sn●kes so fat with poyso●●ill they burst: <hi>World,</hi> let all thy Adders
shoote out their <hi>Hidra-headed-forked</hi> Stinges, <hi>Ha, Ha, Nanci;</hi>
if none will take my part, (as I desire none) yet I thanke thee (thou true
<hi>Venusian Horace)</hi> for these good wordes thou giu'st me: <hi>Populus
me sibylat at mihi plaudo. World</hi> farewell.</p>

               <p>Pitty, alacke pretty heart, thou art sorry to see any good
thing fall to the ground: pitty? no more pitty, then to see an
Innocent Mayden-head deliuered vp to the ruffling of her
new-wedded husband. Beauty is made for vse, and hee that
will not vse a sweet soule well, when she is vnder his fingers
I pray <hi>Venus</hi> he may neuer kisse a faire and a delicate, soft, red'

               <p>I warrant all men are of thy minde: another reason
is, because they sticke like the scutchions of madame chasti|ty,
on the sable ground, weeping in their stalkes, and winck|ing
with theyr yellow-sunke eyes, as loath to beholde the
lamentable fall of a Maydenhead: what senceles thing in all

turne, I doe by the quiuer of <hi>Cupid:</hi> you see the torches melt
themselues away in teares: the instruments weare theyr heart
stringes out for sorrow: and the Siluer Ewers weepe most
pittifull Rosewater: fiue or sixe payre of the white innocent
wedding gloues, did in my sight choose rather to be torne in
peeces than to be drawne on; and looke this Rosemary, (a
fatall hearbe) this dead-mans nose-gay, has crept in amongst
these flowers to decke● th'nuisible coarse of the Brides May|denhead,
when (oh how much do we poore wenches suffer) a|bout
eleuen or twelue, or one a clock at midnight at furthest,
it descends to purgatory, to giue notice that <hi>Caelestine</hi> (hey

there's such delayes in rising, in fitting gownes, in tyring, in
pinning Rebatoes, in poaking, in dinner, in supper, in Reuels,

               <p>In my soule and conscience, and well fauoured

well headed: you see he shootes his bolt sildome, but when
Adam lets goe, he hits: and heere is sir Vaughan ap Rees, and
I beleeue if God sud take vs all from his mercy, as I hope hee
will not yet; we all three loue you, at the bottome of our bel|lyes,
and our hearts: and therefore mistris Mineuer, if you

               <speaker>Sir quinti.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Min.</speaker>
               <p>I thinke (sauing your reuerence) Sir Adam a puppy,
for a dog is the most louing creature to a christian that is, vnles
it be a childe.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Ad.</speaker>
               <p>No, I thinke if loue should bee turn'd away, and
goe to serue any beast, it must bee an Ape, and my rea|son—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Vaugh.</speaker>
               <p>Sir Adam, an Ape? ther's no more reason in an
Ape, than in a very plaine Monkey; for an Ape has no tayle,
but we all know, or tis our duty to know, loue has two tailes;
In my sudsment, if loue be a beast, that beast is a bunce of Red|dis;
for a bunce of Reddis is wise meate without Mutton, and
so is loue.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Ther's the yawning Captaine (sauing your reuerence
that has such a sore mouth) would one day needes perswade
me, that loue was a Rebato; and his reason was (sauing your
reuerence) that a Rebato was worne out with pinning too of|ten;
and so he said loue was.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Vaugh.</speaker>
               <p>And Master Captaine Tucca sayd wisely too,
loue is a Rebato indeede: a Rebato must be poaked; now
many women weare Rebatoes, and many that weare Re|batoes—</p>

your face full of pockey-holes and pimples, with your fie|rie

               <p>Sirra stincker, thou'rt but vntruss'd now, I owe
thee a whipping still, and Ile pay it: I haue layde roddes
in Pisse and Vineger for thee: It shall not bee the
<hi>Whipping 〈◊〉 Satyre,</hi> nor the Whipping of the blinde-Beare,

               <p>Hee does O King <hi>Cambises,</hi> hee does: thou hast
no part of Horace in thee but's name, and his damnable
vices: thou hast such a terrible mouth, that thy beard's
afraide to peepe out; but, looke heere you staring Leuia|than,
heere's the sweete visage of Horace; looke per|boylde-face,
looke; Horace had a trim long-beard, and a
reasonable good face for a Poet, (as faces goe now-a-dayes)
Horace did not skrue and wriggle himselfe into great
Mens famyliarity, (impudentlie) as thou do●st: nor weare
the Badge of Gentlemens company, as thou doost thy
Taffetie sleeues tackt too onely with some pointes of pro|fit:
No, Horace had not his face puncht full of Oylet-holes,
like the couer of a warming-pan: Horace lou'd Poets well,
and gaue Coxcombes to none but fooles; but thou lou'st
<pb facs="47"/>
none, neither Wisemen nor fooles, but thy selfe: Horace was
a goodly Corpulent Gentleman, and not so leane a hol|low-cheekt
Scrag as thou art: No, heere's thee Coppy of
thy countenance, by this will I learne to make a number of
villanous faces more, and to looke scuruily vpon'th world, as
thou dost.</p>

Are you aduiz'd what you doe when you hisse? you

and you may haue more sport: he shall not loose his
