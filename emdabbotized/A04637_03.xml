                     <l>You are a Goddesse, and your will be done;</l>
                     <l>Yet this our last hope is, that as the Sunne</l>
                     <l>Cheares obiects far remou'd, as well as neare,</l>
                     <l>So where soe're you shine, you'le sparkle here.</l>
                     <l>And you deare Lord, on whome my couetous eye</l>
                     <l>Doth feede it selfe but cannot satisfie,</l>
                     <l>O shoote vp fast in spirit, as in yeares;</l>
                     <l>That when vpon her head proud <hi>Europe</hi> weares</l>
                     <l>Her stateliest tire, you may appeare thereon</l>
                     <l>The richest Gem without a paragon.</l>
                     <l>Shine bright and fixed as the <hi>Artic●●</hi> starre:</l>
                     <l>
                        <pb n="13" facs="29"/>
And when flow Time hath made you fit for war,</l>
                     <l>Looke ouer the strict Ocean, and thinke where</l>
                     <l>You may but leade vs forth, that grow vp here</l>
                     <l>Against a day, when our officious swords</l>
                     <l>Shall speake our action better then our words.</l>
                     <l>Till then, all good euent conspire to crowne</l>
                     <l>Your Parents hopes, our zeale, and your renowne.</l>
                     <l>Peace, vsher now your steps, and where you come,</l>
                     <l>Be Enuie still stroke blind, and Flattery dumbe.</l>
                     <p>Thus much (which was the least of the Entert●i●ement
in respect of the reality, abondance, delicacie, and order of
all things else) to doe that seruiceable right, to his noble
Friend, which his affection owes, and his Lordships merit
may challenge, the Author hath sufferd to come out, and
encounter Censure: and not here vnnecessarily adioyned,
being performed to the same <hi>Queene</hi> &amp; <hi>Prince;</hi> who
were no little part of these more labord and ●riumphall
shewes. And to whose greatest part, he knowes the Ho. L.
(had he beene so blest as to haue seene him at his Lodge)
would haue stretcht in obseruance, though he could not in
Loue or zeale.</p>
