I de|fie ye both, and ſcorn to foul my mouth with two ſuch Bag|agges, that for neglect of doing your ſeverall Offices, are now turn'd out of ſervice by my Mother <hi>Parliament,</hi> and now doe ye think to take place? Yes, yes, when my mother hath no|thing elſe to doe, ſo ye ſhall. Get you gon to your King to the Ile of <hi>Wight,</hi> he perhaps may entertain you, (if Colonell <hi>Ham|mond</hi> pleaſes) for my Mother ſhall have nothing to doe with ſuch homely Goſſips as you are; Pray be packing: neither Sta|tute, Juſtice, Law, Reaſon, not Religion, either comes within her doors ſo long as <hi>Ordinancas</hi> eyes be open: And though I ſay't (that ſhould not ſay't,) I have been an obedient Daugh|ter to her, and have up riſing, and down-lying, with all dilli|gence executed her commands <hi>(right or rong)</hi> ſhe knows it well enough, and ſo doth my Father in law <hi>Cromwell</hi> too; and my Reveren'd Uncle, the new <hi>Chancellor</hi> of <hi>Oxford.</hi> High and Mighty <hi>Phillip Switch,</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> will ſweare <hi>Dam</hi> him he loves me; and I muſt love him againe, in deſpight of what doe ye call it <hi>hu, hu, hu,</hi> I <hi>huming Learning,</hi> 'tis; my Mother and I have pepper'd <hi>huming learning,</hi> Biſhops! ha, ha, ha, I laugh to think of <hi>Canterbury;</hi> oh my ſides, how I made him ſhorter by the head, and quite ſpoil'd his <hi>huming learning:</hi> Doſtors cotha; I have caſt their waters for them, and made many of them to

drink water, and to leap at a cruſt too; I laugh to think on't, what doe they call them, Deanes, Prebends and Chapiters; all one with me, or my Unckle <hi>Phillip</hi> either: If we ſay they be all Popiſh, they be all Popiſh, and pray who dare ſay the contrary; then will my Unckle and I out them their profane Nurſeries of Learning becauſe there ſhould be none wiſer then our|ſelves; and put in their Places <hi>Innocents</hi> in Learning, pure <hi>J●norance,</hi> Devout <hi>Folly,</hi> and <hi>Zealous Madneſs;</hi> What though the Wicked terme them Fools, Mad-men or Knaves, ſo long as we are a●l accounted ſo at Weſtminſter; Is it any matter for Learning? Give me my Mother tongue in a pure Parliament Dialects the Alphabet where of begins with K. that is in plain Engliſh Knave, or Knaves: L. betokens Learning, and may be let out, Beſides it is a Numerall Letter, and ſignifies fifty, that is ſome of the Number of the Beaſt; and is uſed in <hi>CharLes</hi>● M. that may ſtand, becauſe we cannot ſpell money without it, which my Mother Parliament loves exceedingly: Money is the main Key of our Work; Take away money, alas <hi>Ordi|nance</hi> is not worth a ſtraw, nor <hi>Parliament</hi> neither: O begins my own Name; wee have taught the people that already, to cry out O, oh! when we kill them; Rob or Plunder them of all they have, and then the poor wretches being ready to ſtarve, will quickly learn O: P. begins my Mothers Name, P. Par|liament, P. Priviledge, Pay, Perjury; P. is the best Letter in our Alphabet. Q. is profane, being the firſt Letter of Queene, and is not to be used in my mother tongue, ſave in two places; Queſtion, and Quarter: R is abomination, and ſo is C too; who hath not read 〈◊〉 we cannot indure it, <hi>Rex,</hi> 'tis as hatefull to us as a Croſſe upon a Steeple; yet in Riches or Re|venue it is tolerable: S ſignifies Seſſments, <hi>Say</hi> and <hi>Seale,</hi> and is a Letter much uſed in Weſtminſter School, as S for Sed●ti|on, S. Sacriledge, S ſlavery: T TOM, T— &amp;c. T Traytors, T Tyburne, T tyrants, and T task-maſters, Turn coats, &amp;c. V. Vote U for me, and ile Vote for U: V ſhall pay for all (U the Common People I mean:) V have undone us all; the Devil take U, and all the reſt of the Alphabet for me; Here be Let|ters enough for my mothers Children; your will with me Statute?</p>
