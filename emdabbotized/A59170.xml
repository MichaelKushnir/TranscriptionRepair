            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>_HE who hath spent some vacant Houres in the rend'ring of <hi>this Peece</hi> into English, conceives it a thing altogether needless to perswade the Reader to a bet|ter liking thereof then his own Judgement shall inclinehim to. For since there are but two things against which the Reader may seeme to except, either against the worke, as <hi>Senceca's</hi> in the Originall, or as <hi>his</hi> in the English, he is of Opinion, that for <hi>the first</hi> it is secure in its owne worth, and himselfe like|wise in the choice of this from amongst the rest of the <hi>Tragedies of Seneca,</hi> if the Reader, as he was, will bee led by the judgement and suf|frage of the Learned. And therefore in that re|spect he thinks it may rather <hi>challenge,</hi> then <hi>in|treat</hi> an Approbation. And for <hi>the latter,</hi> (though he bee not ignorant unto how much prejudice Workes of this Nature are liable, yet) he con|ceives that to seeke by any kind of prepossession to take off the freedome of judgement (he meanes such as hee appeales to the Cen|sure of a Competent Judge) would seeme no other then a Bribery of the Pen, a way not suiting with his Ingenuity. He therefore held it best to expose it as it was drawne in its owne Colours, unset off with any Varnish. Nor shall he take it ill, if he finde the judicious passing a Rigid or severe Censure on the same, since hee
<pb facs="3"/>
declares, it is no more then what hee himselfe hath already done. Yet thus much hee thought fit to desire the Reader to take notice of; that this <hi>Version</hi> (such as it is) is not-by him stil'd a <hi>Translation,</hi> but a <hi>Paraphrase,</hi> (although it may be with some it might finde the Favour to passe under the <hi>first Title</hi>) a way perhaps more generally taking wherein (his Modesty gives him not leave to say so of this Peece●) the Ma|jesty<note place="marg" anchored="true">●e{que} <seg xml:lang="unk">〈◊〉 〈◊〉〈◊〉</seg> esse Inter pretationem tantum volo. s. d circae●sdem Sensus certa|men at{que} aemu|lationews.

Now, whether this be answerable to those * Lawes by <hi>Quintilian</hi> not onely allow|ed of, but commended; let the knowing Reader determine.</p>

It is observed by Naturallists, that the Northerne Seas are lesse Salt then the Southerne: For, whereas the saltnesse of the Sea is conceived to spring from a terrestriall addust matter, mixing with the Waters, when by the Sunne-beames the thinner and fresher parts of the Water are exhaled, and the grosser and lower are left to suffer adustion; It followes, that the Rayes of the Sunne be|ing weaker towards the North, the Exhalations should be lesse, and so cons●quently the Saltnesse. <hi>Vid.

varyin the English, as the Author himself in the Original, first calling it <hi>Lyram,</hi> &amp; then <hi>Cytharam.</hi> The better therfore to in|forme the Ordinary Reader, He may take Notice; That the Words <hi>Lyra, Cythara, Testudo, Chelys,</hi> are by the Poets usu|ally applyed to one and the same Instrument. The three first first so used by <hi>Statius</hi> in the first of his <hi>Achilleids,</hi> and the tenth booke of his <hi>Thebais:</hi> Yet are they severall Instru|ments. The <hi>Lyra</hi> (according to <hi>Pausanias</hi>) being the In|vention of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and the <hi>Cythara</hi> of <hi>Apollo.</hi> The In|vention and forme of <hi>Mercuries Lyra,</hi> is thus describ'd by <hi>Lucian</hi> (in <hi>Dialog● Apoll.</hi> and <hi>Vulcani.) Mercury having found a dead Tortoyse, made an Instrument thereof, applying to the hollow shell, a Neck extending with two Hornes; glu|ing Reeds, and over them straning a Cover, as the Belly of the Instrument, and to that fastning a Bridge, and seven strings.</hi> From this (as <hi>Ioseph Scaliger</hi> observes in his Learn|ed Annotations upon <hi>Manilius</hi>) proceeded the <hi>Cythara</hi> or <hi>Chelys,</hi> likewise called <seg xml:lang="unk">〈◊〉 〈◊〉〈◊〉</seg>, which is no other then the <hi>Lyre</hi> of <hi>Mercury</hi> reformed; for whereas that had two Necks, this had but one, in whose Top, Pegs were placed for the Winding up of the Strings, the very same with our Lute at this day. And as from the Entyre <hi>Lyra</hi> proceeded the <hi>Chelys</hi> or Lute, so from a Part therrof came the Latter <hi>Lyra</hi> usually attributed to <hi>Arion, Apollo,</hi> and <hi>Hercules,</hi> which is no other then the <hi>Lyra</hi> of <hi>Mercury</hi> with the Testude or Back taken away and is in fashion like to two <hi>Ss</hi> opposed, and an <hi>I</hi> transvers'd, thus. <hi>SS</hi> play'd upon both with the Ple|ctrumor Quil, and fingers alone.

                  <p>Concerning <hi>Thule</hi> there is no small difference among Authors. The Poets generally in their Expressions us'd it for a place farre remote, and beyond which there was no knowne land. <hi>Pliny</hi> makes it to bee an Island six dayes saile from Britaine Northward; some have made it to be an Island in Britaine, and others Britaine it selfe so called. <hi>Strabo</hi> confesses the Story of <hi>Thule</hi> to be most obscure; And <hi>Petrarch, l.</hi> 3. <hi>Epist.</hi> 1, having said much, though no|thing positively, concludes at last thus, <hi>Vt nihil● videatur occultior ipsa Insula, quam veritas. Mercator</hi> makes it to be <hi>Izland,</hi> and <hi>Ortelius</hi> will have it to bee <hi>Tylemarke,</hi> a Tract of Norway. Our English <hi>Pausanias</hi> (the learned <hi>Cambden</hi>) supposes it, (and most probably) to be Shetland or Hethland, an Island in the Scottish Seas, lying betweene Norway and Scotland, and under the Dominion of the latter; which his Conjecture he strengthens by the Authority of <hi>Pucerus</hi> who (in his Booke <hi>de d mensione Terrae</hi>) sayes that by Sea-men it is cald <hi>Thylensel.</hi> To this, adding the site of the Island agreeable to that wherin <hi>Ptolomy</hi> places it, he assures himselfe certainely to have found <hi>Thule,</hi> and pronounces the matter to be at an end and questionlesse. Which opinion of his the much-knowing <hi>Selden</hi> seemes likewise to ap|prove of in his <hi>Mare Clausum. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 121. The name of this Island <hi>Suidas</hi> derives from <hi>Thules</hi> a King of Aegypt; <hi>Isidore</hi> from the Sunne; and some from the Saxon Word <hi>Tell,</hi> which signifies a Limit, as if it were a Bound of the North and West. <hi>Vide Cambden de Insulis Britanius. p.</hi> 8, ●.</p>

The Moone on a sudden began to be Eclipsed, which the Souldiers (ignorant of the Cause) construed as a Pre|sage of present Ill-Luck, and comparing their Attempts to the Eclipse, were of Opinion, that their successe should be prosperous, if the Goddesse should become bright againe. Whereupon they began with Trumpets, Cornets, and other Brazen Instruments, to make a loud Noyse; now sad, now joyfull, as the Moone appeared cleare or darke: but when the Clouds rising, tooke from them the fight of the Moone, supposing she had beene hid in darknesse, and utterly lost her light, they began to lament, complaining that that porten|ded their labours should have no End, and that the Gods turn'd their Faces from their Wickednesse. Whereupon <hi>Caesar Drusus,</hi> who was sent by the Emperour to appease them, and whom in a hostile manner they had invironed in the Campe, thinking it fit to make his Advantage of their Fears, so wrought that he composed the Sedition, and cau|sed the Ring-leaders to be put to death. <hi>A Rebellion happily ended!</hi>

These 3 in that they joyn'd together unanimously to the Ruine of others, gave occasion of the Fable of this triple-shap'd Monster, as the usuall ordering of their Forces, the positure of their shapes. For in the Front, or Van, <hi>Leo</hi> still fought, in the midst or battell, <hi>Chimera,</hi> and in the Reare <hi>Draco.
