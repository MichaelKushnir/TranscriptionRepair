               <head>PROLOGUE.</head>
               <l>OUr Auth'ress says to make a Play is hard,</l>
               <l>To censure freely men are not afraid;</l>
               <l>Opinions easily do pass upon</l>
               <l>The wit of others, though themselves have none;</l>
               <l>And envie rounds the sense, and words about,</l>
               <l>Hoping some errors it may soon find out.</l>
               <l>But streams of wit do not so often flow,</l>
               <l>As salt rough censures, which to billows grow;</l>
               <l>And swell so big, till they in pieces fall,</l>
               <l>In their own ruines they are buried all.</l>
               <l>But if our Authors Play deserves a praise,</l>
               <l>She will not thank you, though you give her bays;</l>
               <l>Because she knows it is her right and due,</l>
               <l>And justice to receive the same from you.</l>
               <l>Wherefore she says, if you do take delight</l>
               <l>To read her Play, or acted to your sight,</l>
               <l>The bounty doth proceed from her alone;</l>
               <l>Her wit doth pleasure give to every one.</l>
               <l>The Play, if bad, she doth desire no praise,</l>
               <l>The Cypress will receive instead of bays.</l>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>1 <hi>MAn.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>'Tis reported that the great <hi>Mogul</hi> hath War with the <hi>Parthians,</hi> and a man of our Nation is General of all his Forces.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>2 <hi>Man.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Me thinks it is too great an Honour and Trust to give to a stranger.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>1 <hi>Man.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>But it is reported he hath behav'd himself so wisely, honestly, nobly, and valiantly, as he hath gained the favour of the Emperour, and love of the Souldiers, and also respect from all the inferi|our Princes.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>2 <hi>Man.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Who should this man be?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>1 <hi>Man.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>I cannot learn: for the Merchants from whom I had this report, know not what his right name is; for they think he goeth by a cover'd name.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>2 <hi>Man.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Surely he is of a very mean Birth, that he is asham'd to own his name.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>1 <hi>Man.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>It seems so; but let his Birth be poor or great, he hath a Gene|rous Soul: for they say he is very bountiful, and lives in great magnificence, and carries himself as if he were Princely born: He is the whole discourse upon the Exchange, and the Merchants do cry him up like to another <hi>Iuli|us Caesar.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>2 <hi>Man.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>It seems they fare the better for his being their Countryman, and he to be the Emperours Favourite.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>1 <hi>Man.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>'Tis like enough.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>2 <hi>Man.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Nay you may be assur'd they have a Fee of Obligation, if they praise him so much. Of what Age do they say he may be?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>1 <hi>Man.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>They say is in the prime of his years, a very handsom man, well-behav'd, and of a ready wit.</p>

                     <p>Why should you think so, since youths capacity cannot be measured by their Educators? for Time is the only measure of the rational capacity: And to prove it, some boys and girls will be so dull, as to seem stu|pid to Learning, and yet in their strength of years may prove very rational un|derstanding,

and wise men or women; besides, the Brain is like to the Air, 'tis sometimes thick with mysty Errours, sometimes dark with clouds of Ig|norance, and sometimes clear with Understanding, when as the Sun of Know|ledge shines; and perchance you heard her speak when her Brain was clou|dy and dark.</p>

                     <p>The like for Wit: for certainly, the greatest Wit that ever was, or is, may sometimes be so dull and unactive, as it might be thought they were so far from being Wits, as they might be judged Fools: And cer|tainly, the most Eloquent Orators that ever were, have spoke at some times less Eloquently than at other times; insomuch, that at some times, although the subject of their Discourse is so full of Matter and Reason, as might have oyl'd their Tongues, smooth'd their Words, and enlighten'd their Fancy, yet they will speak as if their Wits had catch'd cold, and their Tongues had the numb Palsy, on which their words run stumbling out of their mouths as insensible; when as at other times, although the subject of their discourse be barren or boggy, woody or rocky, yet their Wit will run a Race without stop or stay, and is deck'd and adorn'd with flowry Rhetorick: And certain|ly, the wisest men that ever were, have given both themselves and others worse counsel sometimes, than at other times; and certainly the valiantest man that ever was, had sometimes more courage than at other times: But yet although a valiant man may have more courage at one time than another, yet he is at no time a coward, nor a wise man a fool.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>Why then may not a Valiant man be at some times a Coward, and a Wise man a Fool, as well as Orators to speak non-sense?</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>Because Valour, Judgment, and Prudence are created in the Soul, and is part of its Essence; I do not mean every soul, but the souls of Valiant and Wise men: for souls differ as much as bodies, some are crea|ted defective, others perfect; but words are only created in the mouth, and are born through the lips, before the soul of sense is enter'd or inbodied therein.</p>

                     <p>An Orators tongue doth rather play on Passions, than compose the Judgment, or set notes to the Reason; like as a Fidler, that can play tunes on musical Instruments, but is no Musician, to compose and set tunes: But there are many men that have eloquent tongues, but not witty souls; they have the Art of words, but not the Spirit of wit.</p>

                     <p>Kind Friends, and worthy Acquaintance, you may think it strange, and perchance take it ill, I invite you only to a simple Dis|course, for to declare a vain Vow, as you may judge it so to be, which Vow I made since my Father the Lord <hi>Sage</hi>'s death. The Vow is, never to receive a Lovers Address, or to answer a Lovers Sute but in a publick Assembly; and 'tis likely the World will laugh at this as ridiculous, or condemn it for pride, or scorn it as self-conceit: But if they will be pleased to weigh it in Judge|ments Scales, they will find it poysed with a good Intention, and make a just weight of Conveniency against unaccustomariness: for though it is not usu|al, yet it is very requisite, especially to such young women which are Or|phans, who like small and weak Vessels, that are destitute of Guide or Pilot, are left on the wide Sea-faring World to ruinous waves, and incon|stant weather; even so young women are to the Appetites of greedy men, and their own inconstant and changing Natures, and want of Experience to guide them, run on Rocks, Shelves, and Quick-sands of Troubles, Misery, and Disgrace, not knowing what safe Port or Home to sail to; whereupon, and in which danger, I considering with my self, at last I thought it the safest way to swim in the full Ocean, and not in the narrow Channels, Creeks, or obscure Corners, lest I should be crush'd to pieces, or drown'd for want of Sea-room; and surely were there a Law to forbid all private meetings of young men and women, and that no women should marry, unless they be wooed in publique, there would not be so many unequal matches, so many perjur'd Consciences, so many devirginate and forsaken Maids; neither would there be such floods of tears from sorrowful Parents Eyes, for their unduti|ful childrens Actions that will choose without their good liking, and marry against their good wills: But they will be asham'd in publique to choose dishonourably or indiscreetly: for the Ears and Eyes of a publick Assembly will be as Reigns, to curb their unruly Passions, and their Applause and Com|mendation will be as spurs to force them to a wise, choise, when in private Wooings their Passions become wilde, and run loosly about, without bridle or check: Wherefore I desire my Friends and Acquaintance to be as wit|nesses of my behaviour and words to my loving and Matrimonial Suters; and in this you will be as Parents to the Fatherless, as Judges to Pleaders, and Gods to Men.</p>

Thus, fair Divine Lady, conquer'd, thus I beg, thus I yield, thus submit: VVherefore Lady, take me, and make your self happy and me.</p>

                     <p>Gallant Sir, should I accept of your Sute, I should be ei|ther an Enemy to my self, or you, or my Country: As for my self, should I marry a Souldier, I should be tormented with the cruellest passions: for if I love my Husband, as sure I shall, I shall be perpetually frightned with his dangers, grieved for his absence, despair of his life: Every little misfortune will be as his Passing-Bell; I shall never be at rest asleep nor awake; my Dreams will present him to my view, with bleeding wounds, mangled bo|dy, and pale visage; I shall be widow'd every minute of an hour, in my own thoughts: for as the Senses are to the Body, so the thoughts are to the Mind, and Imaginations in these, or the like cases, are as strong as a visible presence: for passions live in the Soul, not in the senses; for a man is as much griev|ed when he hears his friend is dead or kill'd, as if he saw him dead or slain: for the dead friend lives in the mind, not the mind in the dead friend: But with these Dreams and Imaginations I shall grow blind with weeping, weak with sighing, sick with sorrowing, and deaf with listning after reports: And should you desist from that noble Profession for my sake, I should prove as a Traitor to my Country, by taking away part of the strength and support, lea|ving the weakness to the force of the Enemy: for a good Souldier is a strong Fort and Bulwark of Defence: Indeed a skilful Commander is to be pre|fer'd before a numerous Army: for a number of men without Order, are like dust, which the least puff of wind blows about; so an Army, not being well commanded, is quickly dispers'd, and suddenly routed upon the least errour; besides, should you desist, you would bury your name in Oblivion, when by your valiant Actions, and prudent Conduct, your memory will be placed in Fames high Tower, and writ in large Characters of praise. 'Tis true, should I marry, I should prefer my Husbands honour before his life, yet would I not willingly marry a man, whose life shall be set at the stake, and Fortune still throwing at it, for that would make me live miserably: And who would wilfully make themselves miserable, when Nature forbids it, and God commands it not?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Vanity.</speaker>
                     <p>Nay, he swore he observ'd the womens Fashion more than the mens, by reason he knew it would make him more acceptable to our Sex at his return, not onely for Discourse-sake, but for the kind rewards he should have for his Intelligence; which rewards he hath found so full and plentiful, as he hath made such a beneficial Journey, as he will go once every year, and stay a moneth or two, and then return.</p>

                     <p>I was here yesterday, Madam, to wait upon you, but you were abroad, then I went to wait upon you my Lady <hi>Parrot,</hi> but you were also from home.</p>

                     <speaker>Parrot.</speaker>

                     <l>All which, fair Lady, if you summ up right,</l>

                     <p>Fair Sir, could Person, Courtship, Garb, or Habit win my love, you should nor could not be deny'd: But since my Affection is not to be won by any outward Form, or Courtly Grace, I cannot grant your sute; be|sides, the lives that Courtiers live, agree not with my humour: for I had rather travel to my Grave with ease, than inconveniently Progress about, ti|ring my body out, lying in nasty lodgings, feeding on ill drest meat that's got by scrambling; but at the best, a Courtiers life to me is most unpleasant, to sit up late at Masks and Plays, to dance my time away in Balls, to watch for Grace and favour, and receive none; to gape for Preferments, Offices, and Honours, but get none; to waste my Estate with Fees, Gifts, and Braveries, to run in debt prodigally, to receive Courtships privately, to talk loud foo|lishly, to betray friendship secretly, to profess friendship commonly, to pro|mise readily, to perform slowly, to slatter grosly, to be affected apishly; no Prudent Brain, or Noble Heart, would interweave the thred of life with such vain Follies, and unnecessary Troubles; besides, I had rather be Mistris of my own House, were it a Cottage poor, than serve the Gods, if Gods were like to men.</p>

                     <p>Pray tell me, what would you do with a Fool? she would be neither good for Breed nor Conversation: for she might bring you a Race of Fools, and vex you with ignorant Follies.</p>

                     <speaker>Holdfast.</speaker>
                     <p>Why should you think her a Fool? she neither appears fro|ward, peevish, or spightful; she hath a sober Face, a bashful Countenance, a natural Garb; she is silent and pensive, which shews she is no Fool; but if she were always laughing, or toying, or singing, or dancing, or simpering, or prating, or had an affected countenance, or affected garbs or postures, I should conclude her to be a Fool. But certainly she must needs have a wise Wit: for she seems melancholy and contemplative, which no fool is; she hears much, and speaks little, which no fool doth: wherefore I judge she hath Wit, but either she is careless, and cares not to express it, or thinks the company fools, and therefore will not express it, or is so bashful, as she can|not express it; and there is nothing shews, or discovers Wit so much as Bashfulness, which shews the Mind and Thoughts so sensible, as they appre|hend beyond anothers perceivance, and so fearful lest they should commit Errors in their Actions and Expressions, as they obscure their Virtues and na|tural Excellencies, for want of a confident Assurance, and a good Opinion of their own Abilities; besides, Bashfulness thinks the least natural defect

a Crime, and every little errour a Disgrace, never to be rubb'd out; they will blush at their own thoughts, and will pine almost into a Consumption, if two or three idle words should slip out of their mouths, or that they should mistake an Argument, or that their Behaviour was not so or so: The truth is, they never think their Actions or their Words well enough done or spo|ken; they are the first that shall condemn themselves, and the last that shall give themselves a pardon: But prethee <hi>Ned,</hi> as thou art my Friend, see if you can procure me, or watch for an opportunity, that I might speak with her alone.</p>

                     <p>Madam, I should not thus presume, did not my Profession dig|nifie me to a Spiritual Office, wherefore a fit Suter to a Divine Lady: And since my Sute is holy, by reason Mariage is sacred, despise me not.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Prudence.</speaker>
                     <p>Worthy Sir, all of your Profession require a solitary Habitati|on for studious Contemplation to a holy life, wherein their Thoughts are Consecrated to Devotion, that their Doctrine may flow from a pure Mind, in Eloquent words, to the ears of their Flock, to instruct them with the light of Knowledge, and to lead them into the ways of Truth; whereas Mariage, although it be sacred in it self, yet it is rather apt to disturb than unite, espe|cially a double Mariage, which are of different Natures: for there are two sorts of Mariages, as a Spiritual, and a Corporal: The first is betwixt the Gods and Mankind; the other is betwixt Man and Woman: The one is by a Consecration and Communion of Spirits, the other is by a Com|bination and Communication of Persons; wherefore those that are maried to <hi>Iove,</hi> ought to keep themselves pure in that Unity: As for the mariage of Combination and Communication of Persons, although it is requisite for the continuance of Mankind, and civil Common-wealths, yet to spiritual Ele|vations is is a great hinderance: for though a woman, especially a Wife, be accounted as a Helper and Comfort to man by her diligent attendance, and loving service, yet women are accounted not only unprofitable in learned Schools, but obstructers to a studious life, for which women are not suffer'd to inhabite in Universities, Schools, or Colleges; indeed we are in a maner banish'd from the sight or entrance thereinto, and men have reason so to do; since learning, especially Divine learning, requires study, and study requires a quiet, solitary, and silent life; and certainly there can be neither solitariness
<pb n="386" facs="205"/>
nor silence where women and children are: for Nature hath made women and children to have restless spirits, unquiet minds, busiless active, and such voluble tongues, as it is impossible they should be silent, whilest life gives them motion; so that a woman is a very unfit companion for Contempla|tions, wherein there should be no other company but thoughts, which thoughts in a Divine, should be only such as are the Inquirers and Searchers of <hi>Ioves</hi> divine Mysteries, and Scholars to <hi>Ioves</hi> divine Schools, and Orators to explain &amp; plead in <hi>Ioves</hi> divine Laws, and servants to <hi>Ioves</hi> divine Or|ders, that they may be Instructers and Intelligencers of <hi>Ioves</hi> divine Com|mands: And though women ought to be instructed in Divinity, yet for the most part, women are obstructers and disturbers of Divinity and Divines; besides, the Original Woman was a Tempter to Sin, which all her Effemi|nate Posterity inherit as a Natural Right and Gift from their great Grand|mother: And though Divines ought to be industrious to cut off the Intail of that Original Inheritance with their holy Doctrine, quenching the fire of Temptation with the spiritual dew of Divine Instructions, yet ought they not to run themselves into that fire they should quench, serving as fuel to in|crease it: Wherefore those that dedicate themselves to <hi>Ioves</hi> Church, ought to live separated from Natures daughters, lest they should yield to hu|mane frailties, and become slaves to the Effeminate Temptations.</p>

                     <p>Husband I hear you have a Mistriss, but I do not wonder at it, for you have taught me (although not by the former, yet by your present practice) to foresee the future event. First, our loves have grown to their full maturity, and therefore in Nature, as Vegetables, must shed their leaves, or like Animals, at such a growth their strength decays, and in old age dyes; thus we may guesse by Natures Revolution, the revolution of our love, though at first we could not dream, but we must discover our dreams to each other, and whatsoever we had heard or seen in each others
<pb n="389" facs="206"/>
absence, when we met, we recounted to each other each object, and repeat|ed each subject and discourses that our Senses had presented to our know|ledge; and not only what our Senses had presented, but what our Conce|ception had conceived, or our Imaginations had created: Also we took de|light to confer in our Houshold Affairs, and we were unquiet, uneasie, and restless, until we met, and had discoursed thus unto each other; and if ei|ther of us had been sick, or had perceived the least distemper in each others health, our grief was exprest by our tears, and by our sighs, which from our Hearts did rise, and flow'd with grief, which poured through our eyes. But now we begin to cast shadows of dissimulation, which shews our love is in an Ecclipse, and from a pretence of the confidence and assurance we have of each other, we begin to be careless of each others discourse or action, giving our selves freedom and liberty to wander, not only from our Home-affairs, but from our profest Affections, to seek for pleasures and delights a|broad, and only a seeming affection and delight remains at home: And thus by a juggling deceit, and false-glac'd love, we shall in the discovery become enemies, and by a seeming wisedom, we shall become fools, and our follies, as well as our crimes, will destroy the unity of Love, and the peace of Ma|trimonial Government; And though we should not break out into open War, yet we shall live factious, and our servants will be as Commoners, si|ding with each Party: But it seems your Mistris hath learn'd your mind so perfectly, and knows your humour so exactly, and can match your appetites with pleasure so justly, as she hath work'd out her designs skilfully, which is, to displace me, and to place her self in your Affections, by which she can make a subtil advantage of your Estate and Fortune, I mean good Fortune: for in bad Fortune she may chance; nay, 'tis most likely she will desert you for those that will and do forsake Virtue, Chastity, and Honour, are not likely to stick to misfortunes, as to follow Banishment, or to live with Pover|ty, to bear injury, to endure Scorn, and to die in Misery. True Love may do it; but for those Affections that are produced by Incontinency, and not bound to Honesty, and setled by Constancy, will change more often than the wind, wavering from person to person.</p>

                     <p>Wife, I confess the Amorous Addresses I have made to other Women; but though I have strayed in my Actions, yet not in my Affecti|ons: for my love is unalterably constant to you, as believing you are unat|terably virtuous, and I do not only love your Chastity, prize your Virtue, honour your noble Soul and sweet Disposition, but I take delight in your Wit, am pleas'd with your Humors, admire your Beauty, and esteem and be|lieve you to be the most perfect and best of your Sex. But Wife, know, that my Appetites, and not my Affections, seek after variety: for the kissing of a Mistris lessens not the Love to a Wife, but rather increases it, compa|ring the falseness and beastliness of the one, to the Virtue and Purity of the other.</p>

I know not whether it be a Judgment from Heaven for their Cozening, or decreed by the Fates for their Covetousness, or bred by a natural Effect of their Lu|xury, which begets an Appetite to Wantonness; but from what cause soe|ver it comes, so it is: wherefore I will never be a Citizens Wife, though truly I do verily believe there are as many virtuous and chaste women, and understanding men that belong to the City, as in the Country; and were it not for the Citizens wealth, more Antient Families would be buried in poverty than there hath been, where many times a rich City-widow, or daughter, gives a dead Family a new Resurrection: wherefore, it is more prudent for men to marry into the City, than it is advantagious for women, especially such women that esteem a pure Reputation before wealth, and had rather live in poverty, than be mistrusted for dishonesty.</p>

But 'tis a sign of a foolish Age, when silence is thought ignorant simplicicitie, and modesty accounted a crime; when in Antient Times Youth was taught sober Attention, and it was impos'd upon Scholars to keep silence five years before they were suffer'd to speak, that they might afterwards be able to Teach, and not always live to learn as School-boys, which they would always be, if they spent their time in words, and not stu|dy and observe: And silence is a discretion that few women practise, being more apt to talk than men; for women are fuller of words than thoughts: but words should be weighed by Judgment, in the ballance or scales of Sense, and deliver'd by the tongue through the lips by Retail, which cannot be if they throw them out so fast: for there is required Reason, Time, and Understanding, besides unstopped Ears to hear them: But though mine Ene|mies laugh at me for a Fool, yet I have so much Honesty, Innocencie, and Modesty, to guard and defend my Reputation, as they cannot wound that with their sharp words, nor laughing faces.</p>

                     <speaker>Strange Wooer.</speaker>
                     <p>Lady, I come not now to plead with flourishing Rhetorick, to make that which is false to appear like truth, or paint a foul cause with fair smooth words: But my cause of request is honest, and what I shall speak is truth; nor do I strive to hide my Deformities or Vices: As for my outward deformities, they are visible to your Eyes; but Vices live in the Appetites, Passions, and Affections, which are only exprest by the Actions, and therefore the easier may be dissembled from the most part of the World, yet not from Heaven, to whom I am to make a just account: And since my sins are only to the Gods, and not you, fair Godess, I shall not at this time make a publick confession of them; but I am come here to present you with my love, which love is as pure as unspotted Angels, it hath no by-respects unto your Wealth, Beauty, or Birth, but barely and meerly to your Virtue: in truth I come a wooing to your Soul, not to your Body, but yet mi|stake me not, I would not have them parted. I cannot say my Estate or Birth deserves you, nor have I merits equal to your worth; but since my love is as pure as your virtue, it will be an equal Match: And though you see my body a deformed bulk, yet I am not asham'd of it, because the owner, which
<pb n="394" facs="209"/>
is my Mind, is honest: for I never betray'd my King, or Country, Mistris, or Friend, nor any Trust that was impos'd unto me by any, although a Foe; I never shut my purse, nor sheath'd my sword from helping the distress'd, nor turn'd my back upon my assaulting Enemy; I never stole good Fame, nor rob'd good Names, nor stab'd Innocency with slander; I never scorn'd those below my self, nor envy'd those above me; I never infring'd the Laws of Honour, nor disturb'd civil Society; and though I cannot suffer an injury patiently, yet I never did omit a duty willingly: As for the truth of what I say, I have none to witness for me, as being a stranger, but my own words, from which this company (perchance) may think self-love and great desire hath brib'd my Tongue; but if they do, their thoughts make Truth no less, no more than Eyes that are blind, Ears that are deaf, can rob you of your Wit and Beauty: for though your Wit they do not hear, nor Beauty see, yet you passess them no less, their want only robs you of their Admiration, not of the Possession; and say I am blind of one eye, my other eye doth see, and I have Hearing perfectly, which doth inform my Knowledge and Under|standing, with that which makes my Admirations and Adorations perfect and sound within my Heart, wherein your Picture is printed on, which my Soul doth view, and gazing, kneels with wonder and astonishment, that so much Wit, Wisedom, and Virtue should be in one so young &amp; fair: And if you cannot love me, despise me not; for my pure Love is Divine, as being divinely placed on you; and it would grieve my Soul, to have the zealous fire and immaculate flame of my Affection extinguish'd with your neglect|ing Thoughts, and rak'd up in the ashes of your Forgetfulness: But if any of my Sex shall seem to jest, or scorn me for my outward form or shape,</p>
                     <l>My Courage and my Sword shall take my bodies part,</l>
                     <l>To cut their Limbs, or thrust them through their Heart.</l>

                     <p>In my opinion it is not strange: for certainly there is a sympathy between the spirits of virtuous souls, which begets love, although in de|formed persons: And this is the true Love; for that which proceeds from Covetousness, or Ambition, or is produced by the Senses, is rather an Ap|petite, which is apt to surfet, or dies as soon as enjoy'd, or turns with For|tunes wheel.</p>

                     <p>I <hi>Iack,</hi> but there is no such law, the more the pity; but this abo|minable money disorders all the World. What work makes it betwixt Pa|rents and Children, Husbands and Wives, Brothers and Sisters, Masters and Servants, Landlords and Tenants, Citizens and their Prentices, Mistrisses and their Maids, and between Kings and their subject? Corrupts all the World, breaks Friendship, betrays Friends, raises Rebellions, commits Treason, and corrupts Virgins: It is the Pander and Bawd to all business; the States-man is fed by this damn'd Lady <hi>Pecunia,</hi> the Lawyer serves her, the Merchants her slave, the Shop-keeper her vassal, and the Countryman her Tenant, Lords and Ladies her pensioners, and greatest Monarchs pay tribute to her; the Logician argues for her, the Orator pleads for her, and many Ecclesiasticals preach for her, the Vicar General and his Conclave are rul'd by her, and the poor Poet, she draws his copperas from his ink, and makes him flatter her. This horrid Lady Sorceress, so to bewitch the World! Is there no law a|gainst this Enchantress, that thus doth still abuse the World, and all that's in it? The very Souldiers sword is charmed by her, and all his guns are si|lent at her presence. This she-devil!</p>

                     <p>As for his private comming home, the reason was, That having oftentimes ask'd the <hi>Magor,</hi> to return into his own Country, and being as of|ten deny'd, and at last threaten'd to be destroy'd if he should offer to go a|way, and quit the <hi>Magor</hi>'s Service: for this Prince was General of all his Forces, and was the man that the Merchants cry'd up to be another <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> although they knew not of what birth or quality he was of; but to get away, he was forc'd to steal away in a disguise, in which disguise he wooed and won his Lady, the now Princess: for whilst he lay privately in the City, until such time as he could hansomly &amp; conveniently discover him|self, he hearing the talk of the Publick Wooing, and also of the Virtue, Beau|ty, and Wit of the young Lady, went to hear and to see her, whom he no sooner heard and saw, and being taken with her good Fame, honouring her Virtue, admiring her Beauty, and being extremely delighted with her Wit, became a Lover, and also a VVooer; but for the better trial of her Virtue, he wooed her in his disguised, deformed shape, and unknown quality, left his Dignity and VVealth might have inticed her Ambition, and not his Merit, to have won her Love, or his Person might have catch'd her Eye, but not his Love her Heart.</p>

                     <p>Yesterday, that was the Wedding-day, my Parents did condemn the Bride, calling her Fool, and saying she was mad, and forbid me to imi|tate her.</p>

                     <p>'Tis no wonder our Natures are so various, when as our Educati|on are so inconstant: for we are instructed to imitate Fortune, which is to be restless, and to spoil that good we have done.</p>

                     <p>No 'faith: for I perceive Fortune hath more power to do hurt than good; for Fortune ruines, or at least disturbs Virtuous Acts, and frustrates Wisedom's Counsels.</p>

                     <p>She is brought to Bed; but on my word she hath had a hard bar|gain: for she hath had a sore Labour.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Gosling.</speaker>
                     <p>She came on such a sudden, as she had hardly Time to send for the Midwife; but she was mightily troubled you were not there, she doubts you will take it ill.</p>

                     <p>We have reason: for if we could not have come time enough to her Labour, we might have come time enough to the cup of Rejoycing.</p>

                     <p>No: for I have as much courage as other maried Wives have, though truly, Sir <hi>Anthony Gosling,</hi> my Husband, was very loth I should goe: for (said he to me) prethee sweet Duck do not go: I answer'd and said to him, my hony-love I must go, for it is the part of one wife to help another; besides, a gossipping company doth help to ease the womens pains; and if I go not to their Labour, they will not come to mine.</p>

                     <p>Perchance a Bridegroom may: for men are sooner cloy'd than women; but a Bride will fondly hang about her Husbands neck a week at least.</p>

                     <p>Yes: for they are set the day of his mariage, and some half a year after they are budded, but not so fully grown as to appear to the pub|lick view.</p>

                     <speaker>Parle.</speaker>
                     <p>The womans: for if the man dies, and his Widow marries again, the dead Husband is horn'd in his Grave, and the living Husband is horn'd in his Bed.</p>
