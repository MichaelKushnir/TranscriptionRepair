For their poore apparrell, tis worne out to the dyet; new they seeke none, and if a man should offer, they are angry: scarse to be reconcyl'd againe with him: you shall not heare em aske one a cast doublet, once in a yeare, which is a modesty besitting my poore friends: you see their <hi>〈◊〉 pe,</hi> though slender, competent: For shirts I take it, they are things worne out of their remembrance.

                     <p>Is it not strange that euery womans will should tracke out new waies to disturbe her selfe? if I should call my reason to accoumpt, it cannot answere why I stoppe my selfe from mine ●owne wish; and stoppe the man I loue from his; and e|uery houre repent againe, yet still goe on: I know 'tis like a man, that wants his naturall sleep, and growing dull, would glad|ly giue the remnant of his life for two howers rest: yet through his frowardnesse, will rather chuse to watch another man.

Drowsie as he, then take his owne repose. All this I know: yet a strange peuish●s and anger, not to haue the power to doe thinges vnexpected, carryes me away to mine owne rui● had rather dye sometimes then not disgrace in publike him whom people thinke I loue, and doo't with oaths, and am in earnest then: O what are wee! Men, you must answer this, that d● obey such thinges as wee command. How now? what newes?</p>
