Perſonated in a Maſque

            <p>_THe Kings Majeſties Maſque being per|formed,
the Queene commanded <hi>Inigo
Iones</hi> Surveyor of her Majeſties works,
to make a new ſubject of a Maſque
for her ſelfe, that with high and hearty
invention, might give occaſion for variety of Scenes,
ſtrange aparitions, Songs, Muſick and dancing of ſeve|rall
kinds; from whence doth reſult the true pleaſure
peculiar to our Engliſh Maſques, which by ſtrangers and
travellers of judgement, are held to be as noble and
ingenious, as thoſe of any other nations: This being
ſuddainly done and ſhewed her Majeſtie, and ſhee ap|proving
it, the worke was ſet in hand, and with all ce|lerity
performed in ſhorter time, than any thing here
hath beene done in this kind.</p>
            <p>The invention conſiſting of darkneſſe and light,
the night preſents the firſt Antimaſques and ſleepe
with his three principall children, the Antimaſques of
dreams: The ſubject of the maine Maſque of light, was
thus introduc'd. The Muſes being long ſince drawne
out of Greece by the fierce Thratians, their groves
withered and all their ſprings dryed up, and out of
Italy by the barbarous Goths and vandals, they
wandred here and there indecently without their or|naments
<pb n="2" facs="3"/>
and inſtruments: The Arch-Flamines
and Flamines their Prophetick Prieſts being con|ſtrained
either to live in diſguiſes, or hide their
heads in caves, and in ſome places, whenſoever they
began to appeare, they were together with peace driven
out by warre, and in the more civiliz'd parts, where
they hop'd to have taken ſome reſt, <hi>envy</hi> and <hi>ava|rice</hi>
by clipping the wings of <hi>Fame</hi> drave them into
a perpetuall ſtorme, till by the divine <hi>mindes</hi> of theſe
incomparable Paire, the Muſes and they were received
into protection, and eſtabliſht in this monarchy, to
the incouragement and ſecurity of thoſe well-borne
wits repreſented by the Prophetick Prieſts of the
<hi>Britanides.</hi> The Scene where this goddeſſe of brightneſſe
was diſcovered, was ſtiled the garden of the <hi>Brita|nides,</hi>
or Muſes of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> not inferiour in
beautie to that of the <hi>Heſperides,</hi> or that of <hi>Alcinous,</hi>
celebrated by <hi>Homer.</hi> The concluſion of all was
an applauſe and confirmation of thoſe Deities or ſe|cond
cauſes by whoſe influence at this prefixed time,
the <hi>Britanides</hi> and their Prophetick Prieſts were to
be eſtabliſht in this garden, by the unanimous and mag|nificent
vertues of the King and Queenes Majeſties
making this happy Iſland a patterne to all Nations,
as <hi>Greece</hi> was amongſt the <hi>Ancients.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ornament which ſerv'd as a Bordure to encloſe
the Scene, was raiſed on two round Baſements, on
which were Satyres bigger than the life, bearing
baskets of fruits, and knots of young Satyres clin|ging
about their leggs in extravagant poſtures: above
theſe ran comicements, which made the ground of
<pb n="3" facs="3"/>
a ſecond order, wherein were termes of women fained
of ſilver, and children in their naturall colours ſtan|ding
on arches, ſome wantoniſing about thoſe
termes, and others holding great vizards before their fa|ces:
On the heads of the Termes were cuſhions which
ſerved for capitals, that bore the finiſhing of compoſed
frontiſpices of great ſcrowles with <hi>frutages,</hi> from
whence hung lighted Lamps.</p>
            <p>In the Freeze above was other young Satyres, which
ſeem'd oppreſſ'd with the burthen of great feſtons,
the husks of which were tied up in knots to a double
compartiment compoſed of ſcrowles, quadratures,
and Maſque heads, in the midſt hung a drapery
fained, of cloth of ſilver, and in it was written
<hi>LVMINALIA:</hi> under all this ranne a large valens
of gold embroidered with flowers and great Taſſels.</p>
            <p>The Kings Majeſtie being ſeated under the State, the
curtaine in an inſtant diſappear'd diſcovering a Scene
all of darkneſſe, the neerer part woody, and farther off
more open with a calme River, that tooke the ſha|dowes
of the Trees by the light of the Moone, that ap|pear'd
ſhining in the River; there being no more light
to lighten the whole Scene than ſerved to diſtinguiſh
the ſeverall grounds, that ſeemed to run farre in from
the eye, with this Scene of darkneſſe was heard the
voyces of Birds of Night.</p>
            <p>This ſtrange Scene having a while entertained the
ſight of the ſpectators, there aroſe out of the hollow
caverns of the earth a duskie cloud, and on it a Cha|riot
enricht and drawne by two great owles, on this
ſate a matron in a purple robe, with ſtarres of gold
<pb n="4" facs="4"/>
and large black wings diſplaied, her browne haire looſe,
and on her head a vaile of ruſſet cipreſſe, with a picked
crowne and a golden Scepter in her hand; Repreſen|ting
night: ſhe tels ſhe came to give repoſe to the la|bours
of mortals: but ſeing all things here tending to
feaſts and revels, ſhee with her attendants will give her
aſſiſtance, though it ſerve but as a foile to ſet off more
nobler repreſentations.</p>

            <p>The habit of the Maſquers was cloſe bodies, open
before the breaſts, of <hi>Aurora</hi> colour, richly embroi|dered
with ſilver, about the waſte ran a ſhort Baſis, cut
in ſtarre-like beames of white, and under theſe were
lower labels, large at the bottome, and cut in a Tre|foile,
tacked together with ſmall twiſts of gold, the
ornament at the ſhoulders comming down to the bow|ing
of the arme, was of the ſame colour and forme as
the Baſis, their arming-ſleeves and skirts of their
gownes as that of the bodies; they wore well-pro|portioned
ruffes, and on their haire ſtood a ſmall bend
or diadem of jewels and ſtartes betweene, which in the
hinder part had a ſcrowle, large at the bottome and nar|row
toward the top, to which their fals of white fea|thers
were faſtned.</p>
            <p>The ſong being ended, the Maſquers came downe
from their ſeat into the roome and made their entry,
betwixt this and the ſecond dance was this ſong.</p>
