           <p>IF your serious occasions will permit me so
              much honour, that this sleight Book may
              bee accepted and perused, I shall justly ac|knowledge
              the favour to be far above either
              my hopes or merit. And if you ever vouch|safed
              your Presence when it was presented on
              the Stage, <hi>I</hi> am confident, your (no-way er|ring-)
              Iudgments will now allow it, as it then
              was intended, which was, rather to provoke
              a laughter, then occasion a contemplation. It
              will likewise engage my grateful service, if I
              be not (in your worthie opinions) taxt of Ar|rogance,
              to present my unpolished lines, when
              daily those of excellence are offered to your Eies
              and Ears: But in the confidence of your cle|mencie,
              <hi>I</hi> submit to the verdict of my grand
              Iury. And how soever you are pleased to cen|sure,
              will remain (as I ought) the humblest of
              your servants,</p>
