For it was but a bor|rowed Booke, for which my promise and credit lye in mortgage 〈◊〉 the Author, the School●master of <hi>Ha●y,</hi> who with some difficulty len● it me, ha●ng no other coppy of this English <hi>Lesson</hi> w●. he prepared for ●a By-exercise for his schollars at the last <hi>Car|neual.</hi> He told me that hee huddled it vp in hast, and that it being onely an essay of his owne faculty, and of the actiuity of his ten|de●lings, he was loath it should come vnder

any other eye, then of those Parents and do|mestique friends who fauourably beheld it, when it was represented by the children. And therefore, I must be, and am tender of suffering it to wander I know not whither, by the out let of your friends hand: whom as I know not, so I cannot challenge of any trust; but require restitution of you, as the Author doth of me. So, expecting without delay, the retu●ne of this bird into the cage, I end with a threat, that if you faile, you must looke to haue this Comedy turned into a Tragedy, and, for detaining this booke, to haue your name set on the backe side of my booke. Whereto I adde yet a de●per curse, that next time you meet with good fellowes in <hi>Epping Forrest,</hi> you may not be so happy, as to feed them with nuts in stead of money.</p>

            <p>I pray you extend your loue so farre to your friend, and your friends friend, as to thinke that neither the first will defraud you of your borrowed Booke, nor the se|cond expose the Author to any inconuenience. The truth is my friend, vpon the sight of this Morall, Scholasticall, Theatricall Treatise, protested that the Author should receiue much right in being thus wronged; and vpon sufficient bond vnder|tooke to saue me harmelesse if I made it more pub|lique then euer was intended. And withall hee armed me with a legall defence, that, if I resto|red tenne sold for the principall, the Author (not|withstanding his modesty) could frame no iust quarrell against me or you at the barre of iustice

There s●re he misses me, and sayes vnto himselfe. Where is my Amphibius? Why keepes he not his accuostomed houre? What, shall I after Philoponus into the tem|ple?


<pb n="11" facs="9"/>
'Tis with the latest now. And (to confesse the truth) alas I dare not there appeare to present my selfe before Apollos Altar. Nor haue I now the bold|nesse to looke my deare Philoponus in the face. His setled countenance and graue gesture giue a che●ke vnto my leuity. His very silence reades vnto mee a ●e|cture of reprehension. My passions so deepe inthrald another way, bid mee now rather to withdraw from such society, and hide my selfe in shades and g●oues, and solitude▪</p>
                     <p>Alas Amphibius, though hauing ●ide himselfe to the mast of safety by the bo●ds of temperance, yet breaketh loose, and leapes into the sea of danger. A|las hee cannot hold. This Sirens song is so attractiue. I yeeld, I come And yet how can I? shall I ●unne a|way from the worthy trade whereto I am bound ap|prentise? My name is inrold in Apol●os register, and shall I rase it out, and be recko●ed among the fugi|tiues and renegados? Not so. And yet and yet it will be so. O how my v●y booke seemes now a burthen vnto me, and that which heretofore did eleuate my soule, and giue it wings to flye aloft, sweet contem|plation of nature and of arts, that now alas layes on me the heauy load of vpbraiding, I flye, I flye, I hast into the by waies of these thickest groues</p>
                     <p>What darke some ca●e will giue me shelter, and hide me from the light of mortall eyes, and of the immortall eye of this world the all-vu●ewing Phoe●us.</p>

I can feare no the eues: the Muses are my guard. And in very truth, what can the eues rob me of? My purse is light, and so my heart. My true riches treasured vp in the cabinet of this breast, no lurching hand by stealth, no robbing rouer by force can seise vpon. My Father hath no land to leaue me. I thinke his meane estate is the better meanes of my happinesse. This education which he astoo●ds me, I take for a more goodly and durable inheritance, then if he could haue left mee thousands of stockes and acres, without any bringing vp in qualitie other then the gentle vanities of the times.</p>

And another secret, better then that, is, in my priuate practising to set vp imagined spectators for the whetting of my care and diligence. And therefore sometime I set vp|on my table, a full auditory of Cushion, Candlestick, Slippars, Bellowes, and Chamberpot.</p>

You know when you put me to this migh|ty Master, you charged mee vpon your blessing to o|bey him, and follow his instructions, rather then the precepts of <hi>Musaeus</hi> or <hi>Apollo</hi> himselfe. But by the next moneth, I thinke the Captaine will giue mee leaue to repeate my postures before you. I will doe your Mothership the fauour to bee in the first forme of my Spectators.</p>

                     <p>Put case that some faire and honourable Lady were mentioned at the Table, and thereupon some busie curious Gentleman should aske you whether there past no tearmes of loue betweene you and her. To deny it, were a derogation from your honou●. To loue or be belou'd is honourable. For you to acknow|ledge it, were perhaps dangerous. Some of the com|pany may be your Riuall, and so rusty iron may leap out of the Ecle-skin, and 'pricke your skinne.

                     <p>Nay you shall haue Philosophy vp to the elbowes. The bed is the beginning and end of a man. When we come into the world, are not our Mothers said to be brought to bed? When we dye, are not we on our death bed? Whil'st we liue, when are we more inno|cent then when we are asleepe in our bed? then wee thinke no body any hurt. When are mischiefes done by men, but when they are awake, and imploy them|selues most busily? <hi>Ergo.</hi>

                     <p>The best Philosophers haue said, and I haue heard it in <hi>Apollos</hi> schoole. <hi>Motus fit propter quietem.</hi> Nature intends motion, that it may attaine rest.
