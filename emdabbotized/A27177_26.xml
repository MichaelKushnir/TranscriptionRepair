                        <l>YOu that can look through Heaven, and tell the Stars,</l>
                        <l>Obſerve their kind conjunctions, and their wars;</l>
                        <l>Find out new lights, and give them where you pleaſe,</l>
                        <l>To thoſe men honors, pleaſures, to thoſe eaſe;</l>
                        <l>You that are Gods ſurveyers, and can ſhow</l>
                        <l>How far, and when, and why the wind doth blow;</l>
                        <l>Know all the charges of the dreadfull thunder,</l>
                        <l>And when it will ſhoot over, or fall under:</l>
                        <l>Tell me, by all your art I conjure ye,</l>
                        <l>Yes, and by truth, what ſhall become of me?</l>
                        <l>Find out my ſtar, if each one, as you ſay,</l>
                        <l>Have his peculiar Angel, and his way;</l>
                        <l>Obſerve my fate, next fall into your dreames,</l>
                        <l>Sweep clean your houſes, and new line your ſceames,</l>
                        <l>Then ſay your worſt: or have I none at all?</l>
                        <l>Or is it burnt out lately? or did fall?</l>
                        <l>Or am I poor, not able, no full flame?</l>
                        <l>My ſtar, like me, unworthy of a name?</l>
                        <l>Is it, your art can only work on thoſe</l>
                        <l>That deale with dangers, dignities, and cloaths?</l>
                        <l>With love, or new opinions? you all lye,</l>
                        <l>A fiſhwife hath a fate, and ſo have I,</l>
                        <l>But far above your finding; he that gives,</l>
                        <l>Out of his providence, to all that lives,</l>
                        <l>And no man knowes his treaſure, no not you:</l>
                        <l>He that made Egypt blind, from whence you grew</l>
                        <l>Scaby and lowſy, that the world might ſee</l>
                        <l>Your calculations are as blind as ye,</l>
                        <l>He th●t made all the ſtars, you dayly read,</l>
                        <l>And from thence filtch a knowledge how to feed;</l>
                        <l>Hath hid this from you, your conjectures all</l>
                        <l>Are drunken things, not how, but when they fall;</l>
                        <l>Man is his own ſtar, and the ſoule that can</l>
                        <l>Render an honeſt, and a perfect man</l>
                        <l>Command all light, all influence, all fate,</l>
                        <l>Nothing to him fals early or too late.</l>
                        <l>Our acts our Angels arc, or good or ill,</l>
                        <l>Our fatall ſhadowes that walke by us ſtill,</l>
                        <l>And when the ſtars are labouring, we believe</l>
                        <l>Jt is not that they govern, but they grive</l>
                        <l>For ſtubborn ignorance; all things that are</l>
                        <l>Made for our generall uſes are at war,</l>
                        <l>Even we among our ſelves, and from the ſtrife</l>
                        <l>Your firſt unlike opinions got a life.</l>
                        <l>O man, thou image of thy makers good,</l>
                        <l>What canſt thou fear, when breath'd into thy blood</l>
                        <l>His ſpirit is, that built thee? what dull ſence</l>
                        <l>Makes thee ſuſpect, in need, that providence?</l>
                        <l>Who made the morning, and who plact the light</l>
                        <l>Guid to thy labours? who cal'd up the night,</l>
                        <l>And bid her fall upon thee, like ſweet ſhowers</l>
                        <l>In hollow murmurs, to lock up thy powers?</l>
                        <l>Who gave thee knowledge, who ſo truſted thee,</l>
                        <l>To let thee grow ſo neer himſelfe, the Tree?</l>
                        <l>Muſt he then be diſtruſted? ſhall his frame</l>
                        <l>Diſcourſe with him, why thus, and thus I am?</l>
                        <l>He made the Angels thine, thy fellowes all,</l>
                        <l>Nay even thy ſervants, when devotions call.</l>
                        <l>Oh canſt thou be ſo ſtupid then, ſo dim,</l>
                        <l>To ſeek a ſaving influence, and looſe him?</l>
                        <l>Can Stars protect thee? or can poverty,</l>
                        <l>Which is the light to Heaven, put out his eye?</l>
                        <l>He is my ſtar, in him all truth I find,</l>
                        <l>All influence, all fate, and when my mind</l>
                        <l>Is furniſhed with his fullneſſe, my poor ſtory</l>
                        <l>Shall outlive all their Age, and all their glory.</l>
                        <l>The hand of danger cannot fall amiſse,</l>
                        <l>When I know what, and in whoſe power it is.</l>
                        <l>Nor Want, the cauſe of man, ſhall make me groan,</l>
                        <l>A holy hermit is a mind alone.</l>
                        <l>Doth not experience teach us all we can</l>
                        <l>To work our ſelves into a glorious man?</l>
                        <l>Love's but an exhalation to beſt eyes</l>
                        <l>The matter ſpent, and then the fooles fire dyes?</l>
                        <l>Were I in love, and could that bright ſtar bring</l>
                        <l>Increaſe to wealth, honour, and every thing:</l>
                        <l>Were ſhe as perfect good as wee can aime,</l>
                        <l>The firſt was ſo, and yet ſhe loſt the Game.</l>
                        <l>My miſtris then be knowledge and faire truth;</l>
                        <l>So I enjoy all beauty and all youth,</l>
                        <l>And though to time her lights and lawes ſhe lends,</l>
                        <l>She knowes no Age that to corruption bends.</l>
                        <l>Friends promiſes may lead me to believe,</l>
                        <l>But he that is his own friend knowes to live.</l>
                        <l>Affliction when J know it is but this,</l>
                        <l>A deep allay whereby man tougher is</l>
                        <l>To bear the hammer, and the deeper ſtill,</l>
                        <l>We ſtill ariſe more image of his will.</l>
                        <l>Sickneſſe an humorous cloud twixt us and light,</l>
                        <l>And Death, at longeſt▪ but another night.</l>
                        <l>Man is his own Star, and that ſoule that can</l>
                        <l>Be honeſt is the only perfect man.</l>
