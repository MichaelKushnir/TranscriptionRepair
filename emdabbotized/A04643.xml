            <p>_THE honor, and splendor of these <hi>Spectacles</hi> was such in the performance, as could those houres haue lasted, this of mine, now, had beene a most vnprofitable worke: But (when it is the fate, euen of the greatest, and most absolute births, to need, and borrow a life of posterity) little had beene done to the study of <hi>magnificence</hi> in these, if presently with the rage of the people, who (as a part of greatnesse) are priuiledged by Cu|stome, to deface their <hi>carkasses,</hi> the <hi>spirits</hi> had also perished. In dutie, therefore, to that <hi>Ma|iestie,</hi> who gaue them their authoritie, and grace; and, no lesse then the most royall of pre|decessors, deserues eminent celebration for these solemnities: I adde this later hand, to re|deeme them as well from ignorance, as enuie, two common euils, the one of <hi>Censure,</hi> the other of <hi>Obliuion.</hi>

            <p>First, for the <hi>Scene,</hi> was drawne a <hi>Landtschape,</hi> consisting of small woods, and here and there a voide place filld with huntings; which falling, an artificiall Sea was seene to shoote forth, as if it flowed to the land, raised with waues, which seemed to mooue, and in some places the billow to breake, as imitating that orderly disorder, which is common in nature. In front of this Sea were placed sixe <note n="f" place="marg" anchored="true">The forme of these 〈◊〉, with their trumpets, you may read liue|ly describd, in <hi>Ouid.

               <hi>Tritons,</hi> in mouing, &amp; spright|ly actions, their vpper parts humane, saue that their haires were blew, as pertaking of the Sea|colour: their desinent parts, fishe, mounted aboue their heads, and all varied in disposition. From their backs were borne out certaine light pieces of Taffata, as if carried by the winde, and their Musique made out of wreathed shels. Be|hinde these, a paire of <hi>Sea-Maides,</hi> for song, were as conspicuously seated; betweene which, two great Sea-horses (as bigge as the life) put forth themselues; the one mounting aloft, &amp; writhing his head from the other, which seemed to sinck forwards; so intended for variation, &amp; that the

            <p>NIGER, in forme and colour of an <hi>Aethiope</hi>; his haire, and rare beard curled, shadowed with a blew, and bright mantle: his front, neck, and wrists adorned with Pearle, and crowned, with an artificiall wreath of Cane, and Paper-rush.</p>
            <p>These induced the <hi>Masquers,</hi> which were twelue <hi>Nymphs, Negro's</hi>; and the daughters of NIGER; attended by so many of the <note n="i" place="marg" anchored="true">The Daugh|ters of <hi>Ocea|nus,</hi> &amp; <hi>●ethys.</hi> See <hi>Hesiod in Theago▪ Orphe. in Hym.</hi> and <hi>Virgil in Ge|orgie.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Masquers</hi> were placed in a great concaue shell, like mother of Pearle, curiously made to moue on those waters, and rise with the billow; the top therof was stuck with a <hi>cheu'rō</hi> of lights, which, indented to the proportion of the shell, strooke a glorious beame vpon them, as they were seated, one aboue another: so that they were all seene, but in an extrauagant order.</p>
            <p>On sides of the shell, did swim sixe huge <hi>Sea-monsters,</hi> varied in their shapes, and dispositions, bearing on their backs the twelue <hi>Torch bearers</hi>; who were planted there in seuerall graces; so as the backs of some were seene; some in <hi>purfle,</hi> or side; others in face; &amp; all hauing their lights burning out of <hi>Whelks,</hi> or <hi>Murex</hi> shels.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="4"/>The attire of the <hi>Masquers</hi> was alike, in all, without difference: the colours, <hi>Azure,</hi> and <hi>Siluer</hi>; but returned on the top with a scrole and antique dressing of Feathers, and Iewels interlaced with ropes of Pearle. And, for the front, eare, neck, and wrists, the ornament was of the most choise and orient Pearle; best set|ting of from the black.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Light bearers, Sea-greene,</hi> moued about the skirts with gold and siluer ●●eir hayre loose, and flowing, gyrlanded with Sea-grasse, and that stuck with branches of Corall.</p>
            <p>These thus presented, the <hi>Scene</hi> behind, see|med a vast Sea (and vnited with this that flowed forth) from the terminaton, or <hi>horizon</hi> of which (being the leuell of the <hi>State,</hi> which was placed in the vpper end of the Hall) was drawne, by the lines of <hi>Prospectiue,</hi> the whole worke shoo|ting downewards, from the eye; which <hi>decorum</hi> made it more conspicuous, and caught the eye a far of with a wandring beauty. To which was added an obscure and cloudy night-piece, that made the whole set of. So much for the bodily part. Which was of Maister YNIGO IONES his designe, and act.</p>
            <p>By this, one of the <hi>Tritons,</hi> with the two <hi>Sea-Maides,</hi> began to sing to the others lowd Mu|sique, their voyces being a <hi>tenor,</hi> and two <hi>trebles.</hi>

            <p>The habite, and dressing (for the fashion) was most curious, and so exceeding in riches, as the <hi>Throne</hi> wheron they sat, seem'd to be a Mine of light, stroake frō their iewells, &amp; their garmēts.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Throne,</hi> (as the whole <hi>Iland</hi> mou'd for|ward, on the water,) had a circular motion of it owne, imitating that which we cal <hi>Motum mun|di,</hi> from the <hi>East</hi> to the <hi>West,</hi> or the right to the left side.

steps, wheron the <hi>Cupids</hi> sate, had a motion con|trary, with <hi>Analogy, ad motum Planetarum,</hi> from the <hi>West</hi> to the <hi>East:</hi> both which turned with their seuerall lights. And with these three va|ried <hi>Motions,</hi> at once, the whole <hi>Scene</hi> shot it selfe to the Land.</p>
            <p>Aboue which, the <hi>Moone</hi> was seene in a <hi>Sil|uer</hi> Chariot, drawne by <hi>Virgins,</hi> to ride in the cloudes, and hold them greater light: with the <hi>Signe Scorpio,</hi> and the <hi>Character,</hi> plac'd before her.</p>
            <p>The order of this <hi>Scene</hi> was carefully, and ingeniously dispos'd; and as happily put in act (for the <hi>Motions</hi>) by the <hi>Kings</hi> Master Car|penter. The Paynters, I must needes say, (not to belie them) lent small colour to any, to attri|bute much of the spirit of these things to their pen'cills. But that must not bee imputed a crime either to the inuention, or designe.</p>
