                  <head>THE ARGVMENT.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>_DARIVS,</hi> the fourteenth from <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> being after the death of <hi>Occhus</hi> for his ſingular valour from the gouernment of <hi>Armenia</hi> aavanc'd to the <hi>Perſian</hi> empyre, became ſo arrogant (Fortune, as it were, ſetting him forward to confuſion) as he ſent to demand tribute of <hi>Phillip,</hi> then King of <hi>Macedonia:</hi> who being of a hautie nature, and inferiour to none of that age in courage, or mili|tarie diſcipline, requited this contumelius meſſage with as diſdainfull an anſwere; threatning that he would come and deliuer it in <hi>Perſepolis.</hi> But being preuented by death he left the execution of his deſigne to his ſonne <hi>Alexander,</hi> who for the great victories which thereafter he obtained was ſur|named the great. He inheriting the hatred of his Father to|wards <hi>Darius,</hi> and far ſurmounting him in ambition, paſt in perſon to <hi>Aſia</hi> with an armie of thirtie thouſand only.</p>
                  <p>After his arriuall, <hi>Darius</hi> wrote to him in a proud and contemptible manner, aſcribing to himſelfe the title of the King of Kings, and kinſman of the Gods, and naming <hi>Alex|ander</hi> his ſeruant. Hee alſo in vaunting manner boaſted that he would haue that mad boy, the ſonne <hi>Philip</hi> (for ſo in deriſion he tearmed him) bound, and beaten with rods, and after brought to his preſence apparrelled like a Prince. For performance whereof he directed one of his Minions with fourtie thouſand, to make impediment to his paſſage at the riuer of <hi>Granick;</hi> where by the wonderfull valour of <hi>A|lexander</hi>
                     <pb facs="53"/>they were ouer-throwne. <hi>Darius</hi> being aduertiſed of this, came himſelfe in proper perſon, accompanied with in|finite, (but euill ordered) nomhers; and encountred <hi>Alexan|der</hi> beſide <hi>Iſſo,</hi> in the ſtraites of <hi>Cilicia:</hi> where hauing fought a doubtfull and bloody battell, in ende by the in|vincible valour, and neuer-fayling Fortune of <hi>Alexander</hi> his armie was defeated, himſelfe put to flight, and his mo|ther, wife, and children made captiues. They were moſt cour|teouſlie entertained by <hi>Alexander:</hi> who notwithſtanding their exceeding great beautie yet would not abuſe them, or ſuffer them to be abuſed by others: nor viſited he them more oft then once (and that to comfort them) all the time of their impriſonment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Darius,</hi> notwithſtanding of all his loſſes (his courage be|ing in the full, whilſt his Fortune was in the waine) wrote very proudly to <hi>Alexander,</hi> taking ſtill the title of a King to himſelfe, but not giuing it him, offering him as much gold, as <hi>Macedon</hi> could containe, for ranſome of the Captiues. Which being very diſdainfully refuſed by <hi>Alexander,</hi> he hauing re-enforced his troupes, &amp; comming forwarder to fight with greater force then before, was enformed how his wife had died in priſon, whoſe death he bewaild with excee|ding great ſorrowe. And vnderſtanding what courteſie <hi>A|lexander</hi> had vſed towards her, he ſent to ſue for peace, not for any feare of his force, but allured (as he alledged) by his courteſie. This ſute being likewiſe reiected, he fought be|ſide <hi>Arbella</hi> with no better Fortune then before. Yet for all theſe misfortunes being of an inuincible courage, and diſpay|ring of peace, he re-aſſembled all his forces, which were aug|mented by the comming of the <hi>Bactrians,</hi> &amp; was comming forward with intention at laſt either to die, or preuaile. But
                     <pb facs="53"/>in the meane time two traiterous ſubiects of his owne, to wit, <hi>Beſſus</hi> whom he had promoted to be gouernour of <hi>Bactria,</hi> &amp; <hi>Nabarzanes</hi> one in ſpeciall credite with him, conſpired his death. VVhich danger, though it was reuealed to him by <hi>Patron,</hi> Captaine of the Greekes, yet he could not, or rather would not eſchue. At length, thoſe two traitours tooke and bound him with golden chaines, and caſt him in an olde Cha|riot, with purpoſe to preſent him to <hi>Alexander.</hi> But they hea|ring how he would not accept their preſent, and how he was comming to inuade them, threw their darts at <hi>Darius,</hi> and left him for dead. In this eſtate he was found by <hi>Poliſtratus,</hi> and after the deliuery of ſome fewe words dyed. <hi>Alexander</hi> hauing exceedinglie lamented his miſerable and vndeſerued end, directed his bodie to his mother <hi>Siſigambis</hi> to be honou|rably buried.</p>
