            <head>TO
THE RIGHT VVORSHIP|full
and his honoured friend,
EDVVARD GOLDING of Colston in
Nottingham-shire Esquire.</head>
            <p>_WHere there is a will to be gratefull, the
acknowledgement supplies the defect
of action, <hi>reddit enim beneficium qui
libenter debet.</hi> Although this hold no
force in the common and municipall
lawes, where men doe no benefit, before they ac|count
to receive; it is allowed a Canon in moralitie,
where many good deeds are to be lost, that wee may
place one well. No man can dye in debt, that hath
an honest remembrance of his obligation, since death
is to bee reckoned from the first day of our ingrati|tude.
In this confidence I appeare, and being
neither guilty of desert, or power to reward, I must
present the memory of your owne act and vertue to
pay your selfe.</p>
            <p>That which waiteth upon my thankes, is this
handfull of paper imaginations, though below your
<pb facs="3"/>
study, not beneath your vertue to accept, and smile
upon; they were meant for innocent mirth, and can
bee no prejudice, if they onely serve to set off your
Nobler Contemplations. Read when you will di|spence
with halfe an houre, and continue your fa|vour
to him, whose ambition is to write himselfe</p>
