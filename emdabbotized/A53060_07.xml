                     <p>Beauty is created and placed oftner in the fan|cy, than in the face.</p>

                     <p>Why do you follow me so much, as never to let me rest in peace and quiet alone? Is it that you think I have beauty? and is it that you are in love with? why, to cure your disease, I will deform it; or do you think I have wit to cure that Imagination? I will put my tongue to silence. I am sure it cannot be my Vertue that inflames you to an intem|perance; for Vertue is an Antidote against it: But had you all the beauty in Nature squeez'd into your form, and all the wit in Nature prest into your brain, and all the prosperities of good fortune at your command, and all the power of Fate and Destiny at your disposal, you could not perswade me to yield to your unlawful desires; for know, I am honest without self-ends; my virtue, like to Time, still running forward, my chastity six'd as E|ternity, without circumferent lines; besides, it is built on the foundation of Morality, and roof'd and cicl'd with the faith of Religion, and the materi|als thereof are Honour, which no subtil Arguments can shake the one, nor no false Doctrine can corrupt or rot the other; neither is the building sub|ject to the fire of unlawful love, nor the tempestuous storms of torments, nor the deluge of poverty, nor the earthquakes of fear, nor the ruines of death; for so long as my Soul hath a being, my Chastity will live. But were you as poor as I, even to move pity, or so lowly and meanly born, at might bring contempt and scorn from the proud, yet if your mind and soul were endued with noble qualities, and heroical vertues, I should sooner em|brace your love, than to be Mistris of the whole World; for my affecti|on to merit hath been ingrafted into the root of my Infancy, which hath grown up with my yeares, so that the longer I live, the more it in|creases.</p>

                     <p>O no, for otherwise my life would be buried in company; for my life never enjoys it self, but when it is alone; and for the most part, all publick societies are like a discord in Musick, every one playing several contrary parts in their actions, speaking in several contrary notes, striking on several contrary subjects, which makes a confusion; and a confused noise is like a disorder'd multitude, only the one offends the ear, as the other of|fends the eyes; and there can be no pleasure but in harmony, which harmo|ny is Quantity, Quality, Symmetry, and Unity; and though quality, quantity, and symmetry are brought by the Senses, yet Unity is made in the mind. Thus Harmony lives in the minde; for without the minde, the senses could take no delight.</p>

                     <p>But why, Doctor, should you think me mad? I have done no outragious action; and if all those that speak extravagantly should be put to a diet, as being thought mad, many a fat waste would shrink in the doub|let, and many a Poetical vein would be dryed up, and the flame quench'd out for want of radical oyl to prolong it; Thus Wit would be starved, for want of vapour to feed it; The truth is, a spare diet may make room in a Scholars head for old dead Authors to lie in; for the emptyer their heads are of wit, the fuller they may be fill'd with learning; for I do imagine, old dead Au|thors lie in a Scholars head, as they say souls do, none knows where, for a million of souls to lie in as small a compass as the point of a needle.</p>

But howsoever, since they are of this o|pinion, I am content to cherish it, if you approve of it; for if I seem mad,
<pb n="220" facs="122"/>
the next of my kindred will beg the keeping of me for the sake of my E|state; and I had rather lose my Estate, and be thought mad, than lose my honour in base offices, and my free-born liberty to be inslaved to whores; and though I do not fear my honest youth can be corrupted by ill example, yet I will not have my youth a witness to wicked and base vice.</p>

                     <p>I did imagine my self Married, my Husband being a Ge|neral of an Army, who had fought many Battels, and had won many Vi|ctories, conquer'd many Nations, at last an unfortunate day of Battel be|ing fought, my Husband being too active and venturous, making lanes of slain bodies as he went, and his horse riding thorow Rivers of blood, those Ri|vers rising so high, as his horse was forced to swim; but the blood growing thick to a jelly, obstructed his way, which made his horse furious, which fury added to his strength, forced a passage over a hill, or heap of slain bo|dies; but the horses spirits being spent with fury and labour, fell strength|less to the ground, with my Husband upon his back; and being in the midst of his Enemies Army, his Enemies seeing him fall, ran about him in great numbers, and so took him prisoner: whereupon his Souldiers soon missing him, thought he was kill'd; upon which belief, their courages grew cold, their limbs unactive, and their spirits so benumm'd, as they all seemed like to a number of stone-statues; which unactive dulness gave their Enemies the Day without any after-blows. I being in the Camp, hearing of my Husbands misfortunes, ran with a distracted fear towards the Enemies Camp; I being espy'd by some of my Husbands scatter'd Troops, was stop'd in the way, and so brought back to my Tent again; where, when I was there, some of my Husbands Officers of the Army told me, That though the Day was lost, yet there was a considerable Body left; which I no sooner heard, but my spirits took new life, and then excusing my fear, told those Comman|ders it was not through fear that made me run out of my Tent; for I did
<pb n="212" facs="122"/>
not fly from my Enemies, but to them, and that I sought death, and not life; and to express my courage, I told them, That if they would give me leave, I would take my Husbands Office, and lead the Army: They told me, that if the rest of the Commanders would agree to it, they were well contented: So when all the Commanders met together, I spake thus un|to them.</p>
                     <p>Noble Friends, and valiant Souldiers, you may think it a vain ambition for me to desire to lead your Army, especially against so potent an Enemy, and being a woman, which female Sex are usually unexperienced in Mar●●|al Affairs, as also by nature fearful, which fears may ruine an Army, by gi|ving wrong direction, causing a confusion through distraction; and truly an Army were not to be trusted unto a woman; management and ordering, if that Records had not given us Precedents, which is, that Woman have led Armies, have fought valiantly themselves, and have had good success, and not so much by fortunes favour, as by their own wise Conduct: And to shew that <hi>Pallas</hi> is a friend unto her own Sex, is, that in all History, there are very few women than can be found, that have lost Battels in the field of Wars, but many that have won Battels; and in all publick Affairs it is to be observed, the Gods do generally assist our Sex, whereby to shew their own power, and to abate the haughty pride of men. But to induce you more; for men trust not so much unto the Gods, as to their own strength, is, that you are present in all Councels and Actions, to assist and direct me; besides, I am Wife unto your General, who was and is an expert Souldier, and a valiant man, although he now had ill fortune; but ill fortune neither lessens valour nor experience, but rather increases them. This gallant and wise man, my Husband and your General, his Discourses have been my Tutors, and his Example hath and shall be my Guide; and if you dare trust me, I dare venture; otherwise I shall stay in my Tent, and pray for your good success. After I had left off speaking, an old Commander which had served long in the Wars, and was much esteemed, answered me as thus.</p>
                     <p>Noble Lady, although your youth doth disswade us, yet your beauty and wit doth encourage us; for what man, although he were possest with fear itself, can run away when a fair Lady sights? for beauty triumphs in all hearts, and commands the whole world: wherefore that man that shall or will deny to follow your Command, is of a bastard-kind, although a lawful Issue. With that all the rest of the Commanders cry'd or call'd out, that none was so fit to Lead and Command them as I. Thus being chosen, I call'd a general Muster of my Souldiers, and then gave order that some of the broken Regiments should be mended and made up with other broken Regiments, also I made new Officers in the room of those that were slain or taken prisoners, and after, I surveyed my Artillery and Ammunition; which done, I drew my Army into a Body, and after I had given Orders and Directions for the Souldiers to march towards the Enemies Camp, which when the Enemy heard of a new Army coming towards them, they drew out the Body of their Army in Battel Array: But I shunn'd to fight so soon as appeared, by reason my Army was tyred with marching; wherefore I gave order to Intrench: Besides, I thought it might give my souldiers more courage, when accustomed to the fight and neighbourhood of the Enemies: But withall, I made some of them give intelligence to the Ene|my that a woman led the Army, by which they might despise us, and so be|come
<pb n="222" facs="123"/>
more negligent, by which negligence we might have an advantage: In the mean time I sent to Treat of a Peace, and to have my Husband set at liberty; but the Enemy was so averse to a peace, as they returned me both jesting and scornful Answers: So when I saw no peace could be made, I drew out my Army into Battel Array; which when the Enemy perceiv'd, they did the like; but it will be too tedious at this time to tell the Form and Figures I put my Army into, as also what Commanders led, or who omman|ded the Horse, or who commanded the Foot that day; only let me tell you, I led the Van my self, and was Accoutred after this manner: I had a Mas|culine Suit, and over that a cloth of silver Coat, made close to my waste, which reached to the ankles of my legs; and those Arms I wore being all gilt, were Back, Brest, Gorget, Pot and Gantlet, all being made light accor|ding as my strength would bear: In my hand I carried my Sword; for be|ing not accustomed, I could not wear a sword by my side, as men do, but whensoever rested, I tyed it to my Saddle-bow, and on my Head-piece I wore a great Plume of Feathers: As for my Horse, he was cole-black, on|ly a white star on his fore-head, and three white feet; my Saddle was crim|son Velvet, but so imbroidred with silver and gold, as the ground could not be seen: But when I was mounted, I spoke as following unto the com|mon souldiers.</p>
                     <p>Worthy Friends, and laborous, and valiant Souldiers, you may justly won|der to see a Woman thus Accoutred like a man, and being one of the ten|der female Sex to be arm'd as a souldier, and in a posture to fight a Bat|tel: Also you may fear the successe of my Command, by reason I am young, and unexperienced, as also unpractised in the Wars: But fear not, the gods are with me, and will assist me, and have promised to give you victory by my Conduct; for they will conduct me: But the Gods suffer'd the other Battel to be lost, because many Victories had made you proud, and conceit|ed of your selves, and your own valours, trusting more to your own strength, than to their favours or powers, whereupon the Gods destroy'd many of you; but since they have taken pity of you, drawn to it by your humility: whereupon the Gods have commanded me to Lead and Conduct you; and they have also commanded me to tell you, That if you trust in them, and fight couragiously, that you shall have Victory, and rich Spoils; for I heard the common people, of which common souldiers were of, were apt to be su|perstitious, and to believe in any new reports, as also to believe in Miracles, Prophecies, and the like, and withall, very covetous; all which, made me feign my self to be commanded immediately from the Gods, and to be sent as from the Gods to command them, and to declare such promises to them; for all the common souldiers sight for Spoils, not for Honour.</p>

                     <p>My passion will strive to maintain my honour, and you may take my life; but as long as I live, my passion will fight in the quarrel. But what man of honour will make a Bawd of her he intends to make his Wife? and what man of honour will be cruel to those that are weak, helplesse, and shiftlesse? and what man of honour will be uncivil to the meanest of our Sex? It is more noble to flatter us, than to quarrel with us;
<pb n="227" facs="125"/>
but that I have heard you are valiant, I should think you were a base cow|ard, and such a one that would quarrel in a Brothel-house, rather than fight in a Battel: But I perceive you are one that loves Pleasure more than Ho|nour, and Life more than Fame; and I hate to be in that mans company, or to make a Husband, whose courage lies in Volupmousness, and his life in Infamy: I will sooner marry Death, than such a man.</p>

                     <p>VVhy not? since fame many times arises from poor Cottages, as well as from great Palaces; witness the Country labouring-man, that was taken from the plough, and made an Emperour, as being thought sittest to rule, both for Justice and VVisedome, and he was more famous than those that were born of an Heroick Line, and were of Royal dignity; and <hi>David</hi> a shepherd, became a King.

                     <p>Mistake not my discourse, it hath no such devilish design; for to tempt, is to pervert: 'Tis true, my Nature takes delight to delight and please others, and not to crosse or displease any, yet not to tempt, or to de|lude with counterfeit demeanors, or fair insinuating words, smooth speech, or oiled tongue, to draw from Virtues side, but to perswade and plead in Virtues cause.</p>

Rhetorick I had, and pleaded with as powerful arguments as I could finde, any promised more than I was able to perform, and nothing of this could get her forth, until I told her I would bring your Ladyship to visit her, and that forced her out; for she said, she would rather trouble you, than you should trouble her.</p>

                     <p>All that are wise, and would be happy; for should not we think that man were mad, that leaves a peaceful habitation, and thrusts him|self in forein broyls? or should not we think a King were most unjust, that makes his peaceful and obedient subjects slaves to strange Princes? The Mind's a Common-wealth, and the Thoughts are the Citizens therein, and Reason rules as King, or ought to doe: But there is no reason we should vex our Thoughts with outward things, or make them slaves unto the world.</p>

                     <p>I say not so; for though the World draws not my Minde to wander up and down, yet my Minde draws the World to it, then pensils out each several part and piece, and hangs that Landskip in my Brain, on which my thoughts do view with Judgments eyes. Thus the world is in my Minde; although my Minde is not in the world.</p>

                     <p>The Appetites are none of the Mind's Citizens, but they are an unruly Rout that dwell in the Senses, which are the Suburbs of the Body: Indeed the Appetites are the Out-Lawries, and doe oft-times much hurt with their disorders, insomuch as they, many times, disturb the mindes tranquillity, and peace. But, Madam, lest the appetite of talking should di|sturb the Mind, I shall kiss your Ladyships hand, and leave you to those that are more delightful and pleasanter company than I am.</p>

                     <p>By Example and Skill; for when the Minde is raging mad; Poets, with gentle perswasions, in smooth numbers, and soft musick, cure it; and when the Mind is despairing, Poets draw hopes into numbers, which beats out the doubtful Foe: And for Example.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>David</hi> with his Poetical Inspirations, and Harpsical harmonious Musick, allay'd the ill Spirit, and raging passion of <hi>Saul</hi>; for Poets take from the sweet Spring of Nature, an Oil of Love, and from Heaven, the Balsom of Mercy, and pour them through golden numbers, and pipes of wit, into the fester'd wounds of despair, when oft-times Divines, in stead of suppling Oil, pour in corroding Vitriol, and in stead of healing Balsoms, pour in burning Sulphure, which are terrifying threats, and fearful menaces: where|fore Lady, let me advise you as a Poetical Physician, to keep your minde cool, and your thoughts in equal temper; wherefore in order thereto, when the minde is wrapt in the mantle of Imagination, if it finds it self very hot therewith, let it lay that mantle by, and bathe it self in the fresh, clear, pure Rivers of Discourse.</p>

                     <p>By your favour, Sir, for the most part, the Mind becomes hotter with the motion of the tongue, than the mantle of Imagination; for when the tongue hath liberty, it runs wildly about, and draggs the minde af|ter it; and rather than I will have my minded dragg'd and hurried about by my unruly tongue, which will neither endure the bit of Reason, nor the bri|dle of Discretion, but runs beyond all sense, I will tye up my tongue with the cords of silence, in the stable of the mouth, and pull down the Port-cullis of the teeth before it, and shut the doors of my lips upon it. Thus shall it be treble lock'd, and kept with the Key of Judgment, and the Authority of Prudence.</p>

                     <speaker>Lady Conversat.</speaker>
                     <p>First, to be an open Enemy, as to declare the enmity; next, to declare their endeavour to prosecute to the utmost of their power, either their Enemies Estate, Liberty, and Life; whereas a base Revenger is to dissemble, in professing they have forgotten and forgiven their injury, and pardon'd their Enemy, yet under-hand and disguisedly endeavour to do their Enemy a mischief. Not but an honourable Revenger may choose their time for executing their revenge; but they must declare they will be revenged be|fore they execute their revenge, and let their Enemies stand upon their Guard.</p>

                     <p>Why not, as well as a revengeful man? For why may not a woman revenge her scandaliz'd honour as well as a man? Is there any reason why it should be a dishonour for a man to pass by a disgrace, and for a woman to revenge her disgrace? Is it not as great a blemish to the honour of a woman, to be said to be unchaste, as for a man to be said to be a Cow|ard? And shall a woman only sit and weep over her lost honour, whilest a man fights to regain his? And shall it be thought no dishonour for a man to pistol, or at least bastonade another man for an injury, or an affront re|ceiv'd, and a fault for a woman to do, or cause to be done the like? Must women only sit down with foolish patience, and endure wrong, when men may execute revenge with fury? These were both injustice, and an unjust act of Education to our Sex; as also it would be an unjust sentence, not on|ly from men, but from the Gods, since neither Gods nor men will suffer in|jury, wrong, or dishonour, without revenge: But if Gods, Men, and Edu|cation should be so unjust to our Sex, yet there is no Reason in Nature we should be so unjust to our selves: But for my part, as I am constant to an honest friend, and can easily forgive an honourable Enemy, so I can never forgive a malicious Foe, nor forget a vain-glorious bragging fool, or false slandring knave, but will persecute them to the utmost of my power, and the weight of my revenge should be according to the pressure of my injury, or dishonour.</p>

                     <p>But let me tell you, Madam, those that brag are seldome be|liev'd, and there is none that believe these vain bragging Ranters; for it's well known, that all Ranters are idle deboyst persons, and do usually belye the most Honourable and Chaste Ladies, for which all worthy persons hate them, and account them so base, as they will shun their companies; no man of honour will come near them, unless it be to beat them.

                     <p>She is a Lady, born from a Noble Stock, and hath been choisely bred, but ruin'd by misfortunes, which makes her poorly serve.</p>

                     <p>Sure it cannot be: But why should I doubt? her Beauty, Wit, and sweet Demeanour, declares her Noble Pedigree: The Lord <hi>Morality</hi> was a Famous man, and was a great Commander, and wise in making Lawes, and prudent for the Common Good: He was a Staff and Prop un|to the Common-wealth, til Civil Wars did throw it down, where he fell under it.

                     <speaker>Old Human.</speaker>
                     <p>This is She I mention, and if Times mend, will have her Fa|thers Estate, as being her Fathers Heir; but to prove it, and her Birth, I will bring all those servants that liv'd with her, and with her Father, and all his Tenants, that will witness the truth.</p>

                     <p>Thou Celestial Creature, do not believe that I am so pre|sumptuous to ask thy love, I only beg thy pardon, that when my body lies in the silent grave, you give my restless soul a pass, and leave to walk a|mongst sad Lovers in dark and gloomy shades; and though I cannot weep to shew my penitence, yet I can bleed.</p>

                     <p>It seems strange to me, that you, a wise man, or at least ac|counted so, should fall into such extreams, as one while to hate me to death, and now to profess to love me beyond life!</p>

                     <speaker>Lord Courts.</speaker>
                     <p>My Debaucheries blinded my Judgment, nor did I know thy worth, or my own errour, until thy wise wit gave the light to my dark understanding, and you have drawn my bad life, and all my unworthy acti|ons therein, so naturally in your discourse, as now I view them, I do hate my self as much as you have cause to hate me.</p>

                     <p>I only hate your Crimes, but for those excellent Qualities, and true Virtues that dwell in your Soul, I love and honour; and if you think me worthy to make me your Wife, and will love me according as my honest life will deserve your affections, I shall be proud of the Honour, and thank Fortune or Heaven for the Gift.</p>

                     <p>God bless you Honour from her, it is not fit for a Lord, and a great Noble-man to meddle with Virtue, your Honour should not foul your fingers with her: Besides, she will never stay in a great mans house, neither is it fit she should; and your Honours servants will hate her like the Devil, for she will please no body as she should do, a very peevish, ill-natur'd girle forsooth she is.</p>

                     <p>Alas forsooth, if it please your Honour, Virtue may live in a Cottage, when she will be whipt out of a Court, or a great Lords Palace; they may talk of her, but they will never give her leave to live and board with them: It may be they give their Chaplain leave to talk of her a Sun|days, or so forsooth, but talk's but talk, for they forget her the six days after,
<pb n="237" facs="130"/>

                     <p>I will tell you: A while since, there came the Muses to visit me, being all either mad, or drunk, for they toss'd and tumbl'd me, and rumbl'd me about, from one to the other, as I thought they would a divi|ded me amongst them: At last came in the Sciences to visit me, with sober Faces, grave Countenances, stayd and formal Behaviours, and after they had Saluted me, they began to talk very seriously to me, their Discourse being Rational, Probable, Wise, Learned, and Experienc'd; but all the while the Muses would not let me alone, one pull'd me to Dance, another to Sing, another to play on Musick, others to recite Verses, speak Speeches, and Act parts of Plays, and the like● Whereupon I gravely turned the in|corporal head of my rational Soul, nodding it to them to be quiet, and let me alone, but still they playd with me: At last my Thoughts, which are the language of the Soul, spoke to them, and pray'd them to forbear, until such time as the Sciences were gone; but they would not be quiet, nor silent, doe
<pb n="239" facs="131"/>
what I could, but would interrupt the Sciences in the midst of their Dis|course, with their idle Rimes, light Fancies, and odd Numbers, insomuch as the Sciences departed: Whereupon the Muses did rejoyce, and skip, and run about, as if they had been wilde: And in this jocund humour, in came the Arts, even a whole Common-wealth; for there were not only Politick Arts, Civil and Combining Arts, Profitable and necessary Arts, Military Arts, and Ceremonious Arts; but there were Superstitious Arts, Idola|trous Arts, false, factious, and mischievous Arts, destructive and wicked Arts, base and mean Art, foolish, childish, vain, superfluous and unprofita|ble Arts: Upon all these Arts the Muses made good sport; for at some they flung jests, scorns, and scoffs, and some they stripp'd naked, but to others they were cruel, for some they stayd their skins off, and others they made very Skeletons of, dissecting them to the very bones; and the truth is, they spa|red not the best of them, but they had one saying or other to them: But when all the Arts departed, they took me, and carry'd to the Well of <hi>Heli|con,</hi> and there they threw me in over head and cares, and said they would Souse me in the Liquor of Poetry; but when I was in the Well, I thought verily I should have been drown'd, for all my outward Senses were smo|ther'd and choak'd, for the water did blind my eyes, stop'd my ears and no|strils, and fill'd my mouth so full, as I had not so much space as to spout it sorth; besides all my body was so numb, as I had no feeling, insomuch, as when they took me out of this Well of <hi>Helicon,</hi> into which they had flung me, I seem'd as dead, being quite senseless: Whereupon they all agreed to take and carry me up on <hi>Parnassas</hi> Hill, and to lay me on the 〈◊〉 thereof, that the Poetical Flame, or Heat therein, might dry and warm me; after which agreement they took me up, every one bea●ing a part o● m●, or was industrious about me, for some carried my Head, others my Legs, some held my Hands, others imbraced my Waste, another oiled my Tongue, and o|thers powr'd Spirits into my Mouth, but the worst-natur'd Muse pinch'd me, to try if I was sensible, or not, and the sweetest and tenderest natur'd Muse wept over me, and another was so kind as to kiss me; but when they had brought me up to the top of the Hill, and laid me thereupon, I felt such a heat, as if they had laid me on <hi>AEtna</hi>; but after I had layn some time, I felt it not so hot, and so less and less, until I felt it like as my natural heat; just like those that goe into a hot Bathe, at first crie out it is insufferable and scalding hot, yet with a little use will sinde it cool enough: But whilest I lay on <hi>Parnassus</hi> Hill, I began to make a <hi>Lyrick</hi> Verse, as thus.</p>

                     <p>But your unfortnnate Visit hath pull'd me so hastily down from the Hill, that the force of the speed hath crack'd my Imaginary Fiddle, broke the Strings of my Wit, blotted the Notes of Numbers, so spoil'd my Song.</p>

                     <p>I hate Civility and Manners in a man, it makes him ap|pear sneakingly, poorly, and effeminate, and not a Cavalier: Bold and free Actions become your Sex.</p>

<hi>Sir Golden Riches,</hi> who did tempt me with Gold till he had his desire, you know all what it is, and I like an honest woman, as it were, kept my word, and performed truly as any woman could do: Speak, canst thou detect me either in word or deed? and like a false and covetous wretch as thou art, performed nothing with me as thou shouldst have done, I am sure of that: Is't not a truth? speak coverous wretch, speak.</p>

                     <p>Why thou didst promise me an hundred pounds in gold, shew'd it me, and then took it away again; nay further, thou saidst I should be a Lady, and have a great parimanus Coach gilt, with neighing Horses, and a Coachman, with a Postilion to ride afore: Nay, nay, I remember well e|nough what you said, you talkd of <hi>Gesemond, Pomatum,</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Gunpow|der for my hair, and fine gowns and stockings, and sine lac'd silk garters, and roses shining like Stars, God bless us!</p>
