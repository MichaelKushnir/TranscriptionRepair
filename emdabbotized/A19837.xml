thoſe beautifull Carrecters of ſence were eaſier to be

haue mortall men apparelled all the vertues, all the
graces, all bleſsings, with that ſhape wherewith them|ſelues
are moſt delighted, and which worke the beſt
motions, and beſt repreſent the beauty of hea|uenly
powers. And therefore, reuerend Prophe|teſſe,
who heare attendeſt vpon the deuotions of this
place, prepare thy ſelfe for thoſe rites that pertaine to
thy function, and the honour of ſuch deities. And to
the end thou maiſt haue a fore-notion what powers,
and who they are that come; take here this Proſpe|ctiue,
and herein note and tell what thou ſeeſt: For
well maiſt thou there obſerue their ſhadowes, but
their preſence will bereaue thee of all, ſaue admirati|on

Spheres of there owne being from whence they are.
But yet of my ſelfe, this much I muſt reueale, though
againſt the warrant of a Meſſenger, who, I know had
better to fayle in obedience, than in preſumption,
that theſe Deities by (the motion of the all-directing
Pallas, the glorious Patroneſſe of this mighty Monar|chie)
deſcending in the Majeſtie of their inuiſible eſ|ſences,
vpon yonder Mountaine; found there the beſt
and moſt worthy, the beſt of Ladies, diſporting her
ſelfe with the choiſeſt attendants, whoſe formes they
preſently tooke, as delighting to be in the beſt built
Temples of beauty and honour, and in them vouch ſafed
to appeare in this manner, being otherwiſe no
objects for mortall eyes.</p>

rather at their inuocation, knowing all their deſires
to be ſuch, as euermore to grace this glorious Mo|narchie,
