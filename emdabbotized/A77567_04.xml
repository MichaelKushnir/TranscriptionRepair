If you never reade it, it is the rareſt book that ever you read in your life. Open it where you will, and you ſhall learn ſomething. As here now. One refuſing to eat Cheeſe|cakes, was ask't his reaſon. He told them he lov'd the fleſh well, but was afeard of the bones. Then here's the next to't. One asking whence Lobſters were brought: his fellow repli'd, one might eaſily know their countrey by their coat. They are fetch't from the red ſea. Now would I might never eat more of 'hem, as well as I love 'hem, if <hi>I</hi> know what Cheeſe-cakes were made of, or from whence Lobſters came be|fore.</p>
