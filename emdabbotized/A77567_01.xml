                  <p>_OR rather <hi>to the Spe|ctators,</hi> if the Fates ſo pleas'd, theſe <hi>Come|dies</hi> exactly being dreſſed for the <hi>Stage;</hi> and the often-tried <hi>Author</hi> (better than many who can but ſcribble) under|ſtood the <hi>Proportions</hi> and <hi>Beauties</hi> of a <hi>Scene;</hi> But as they are they will not deceive you; for the ſame hand (which formerly pleas'd) now held the Pen. VVe ſuppoſe we bring what in theſe dayes you ſcarce could hope for, <hi>Five</hi>
                     <pb facs="4"/>
                     <hi>new Playes</hi> We call them <hi>new,</hi> becauſe till now they never were printed. You muſt not think them <hi>posthumous</hi> Pro|ductions, though they come into the world after the <hi>Author's</hi> death: they were all begotten and born (and own'd by Him before a thouſand witneſſes) many years ſince; they then trod the <hi>Stage</hi> (their proper place) though they paſs'd not the <hi>Preſs.</hi> They are all <hi>Comedies,</hi> for (a man would think) we have had too many <hi>Tra|gedies.</hi> But this Book knew them not. The <hi>ENGLISH MOOR</hi> here (what ever name or face it wears) is older than our Troubles. The <hi>LOVE-SICK COURT,</hi> and the <hi>AMBITIOUS POLITICK</hi> are but one Play, though ſtrange thoſe two ſhould dwell toge|ther. This <hi>NEW ACADEMY</hi> con|cerns not that which eight years ſince peep'd up in <hi>Write Friers;</hi> and this <hi>NEW EXCHANGE</hi> knows no|thing
<pb facs="4"/>
of that which now is cleaving to the <hi>Great Church</hi> VVall. This <hi>QUEEN</hi> is a meer ſtranger to our <hi>Iſland;</hi> Her Scene is <hi>Sicily,</hi> the Perſons and Action taſte nothing of <hi>England.</hi> Thus the whole <hi>Book</hi> being free and ingenuous, we hope the <hi>Author</hi> may have the ſame allowance, eſpecially now ſince he's gone to the great Wits, that is, dead. And yet there are a ſort (one would wonder there ſhould be) who think they leſſen this <hi>Author's</hi> worth when they ſpeak the relation he had to <hi>Ben. Johnſon.</hi> VVe very thankful|ly embrace the Objection, and deſire they would name any other Maſter that could better teach a man to write a good Play. The materials muſt flow from all parts of the world; but the <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Compoſition</hi> come onely from Books and ſuch living Maſters as that our great <hi>Laureat;</hi> And for this purpoſe we have here prefixt <hi>Ben Johnſon</hi>'s own
<pb facs="5"/>
teſtimony to his Servant our <hi>Author;</hi> we grant it is (according to <hi>Ben</hi>'s own nature and cuſtome) magiſterial e|nough; and who looks for other, ſince he ſaid to <hi>Shakeſpear—I ſhall draw envy on thy name</hi> (by writing in his praiſe) and threw in his face<hi>—ſmall Latine and leſs Greek;</hi> but alſo told <hi>Sel|den</hi> himſelf (as if <hi>Ben's</hi> conſcience checked him for being too good na|tured in commending others.)</p>

                  <head>EPILOGUE.</head>
                  <l>Now let me be a modoſt undertaker</l>
                  <l>For us the players, the play and the play-maker:</l>
                  <l>If we have faild in ſpeech or Action, we</l>
                  <l>Muſt crave a pardon; If the Commedy</l>
                  <l>Either in mirth, or matter be not right,</l>
                  <l>As 'twas intended unto your delight,</l>
                  <l>The Poet in hope of favour doth ſubmit</l>
                  <l>Ʋnto your cenſure both himſelf and it,</l>
                  <l>Wiſhing that as y'are judges in the cauſe</l>
                  <l>You judge but by the antient Comick Lawes.</l>
                  <l>Not by their courſe who in this latter age</l>
                  <l>Have ſown ſuch pleaſing errors on the ſtage,</l>
                  <l>Which he no more will chuſe to imitate</l>
                  <l>Then they to fly from truth, and run the State.</l>
                  <l>But whether I avail, you have ſeen the play,</l>
                  <l>And all that in defence the Poet can ſay</l>
                  <l>Is, that he cannot mend it by a jeſt</l>
                  <l>I'th Epilogue exceeding all the reſt;</l>
                  <l>To ſend you off upon a champing bit,</l>
                  <l>More then the ſcenes afforded of his wit:</l>
                  <l>Nor ſtudies he the Art to have it ſaid</l>
                  <l>He ſculks behind the hangings as affraid</l>
                  <l>Of a hard cenſure, or pretend to brag</l>
                  <l>Here's all your money again brought in i'th bag</l>
                  <l>If you applaud not, when before the word</l>
                  <l>'Twas parcel'd out upon the ſhearing-board.</l>
                  <l>Such are fine helps; but are not practiſed yet</l>
                  <l>By our plain Poet who cannot forget</l>
                  <l>His wonted modesty, and humble way</l>
                  <l>For him and us, and his yet doubtful play,</l>
                  <l>Which, if receiv'd or but allow'd by you,</l>
                  <l>We and the play are yours, the Poet too.</l>
