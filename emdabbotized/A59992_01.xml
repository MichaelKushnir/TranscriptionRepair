                  <p>_The Memory and Contempla|tion
of good Offices recei|ved,
which, by their own na|ture,
and impulsion, have
inclined other men to bee
active in their returnes, have not wrought me
into so much boldness; For when I considered
my obligation to your favors I was still deter|red
by their greatness and number; For in my
poverty I had thoughts not without Ambition
to reach them with some merit, but when I was
studying to proportion my gratitude, I fell
much lower than when I was the object of your
mercy. The way to releeve my self, is no more
to look at what you have confer'd, but on
<pb facs="5"/>
the bestower, for I have now learn'd to sepa|rate
you from your benefits, and to convey my
self into your pardon, by the exercise of your
Charity. Thus in place of cancelling my former
debts, I put your vertue to a new disburs|ment:
Witness this Composition, which after
its birth, had in my thoughts a dedication to
your name, although it but now took the bold|ness
to wear it in the forehean both as an Or|nament
and preserver. You were pleas'd to
grace it with your fair opinion, when it was re|presented,
and though it appear not in that
naturall Dress of the Scene, nor so powerfull,
as when it had the soul of action, yet your
smile upon it now will give it second animati|on;
by which I shall derive after so long a si|lence,
a Confirmation of my happiness, in be|ing
still received</p>

                  <l>I doe not like the Prologue, 'tis not smart,</l>
                  <l>Not aery, then the play is not worth a—</l>
