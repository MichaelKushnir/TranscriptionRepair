of this Tragedy.</head>
               <p>IVno the Wyfe and ſiſter of Iupiter, hating his baſtard bro●de, cometh
dovvne from heauen, complayning of all his iniuries done to her, deui|ſing
alſo by vvhat deſpight she may vexe his baſe Sonne Hercules. And
hauing by experience proued, no toyles to be to hard for him, findeth the
meanes to make his ovvne hand his ovvne vengeance. Hercules therefore
returning novv from Hell (from vvhence he vvas enioyned to fet Cerbe|rus)
and finding that the Tyrant Lycus had inuaded his coūtrey, deſtroi|eth
the tyrant. For the vvhich victory as hee ſacrificeth to his Goddeſſe,
vvrathfull Iuno ſtrikes him into a ſodayne frenſy: Wherevvith he beinge
ſore vexed, thynking to ſlea the Children and Wyfe of Lycus, in ſteede of
them, killeth his ovvne Wyfe and Children in his madnes. This done hee
ſleapeth. Iuno reſtoreth to him agayne his Wits. He being vvakt, ſeing his
Wyfe and Children ſlayne by his ovvne hand, at laſt alſo vvould kill him|ſelfe.</p>
