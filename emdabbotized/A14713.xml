THe prudent Prince Salomon, doth say,</l>
            <l>He that spareth the rod, the chyld doth hate</l>
            <l>He wold youth shuld be kept in awe alwaye</l>
            <l>By correction in tyme at reasonable rate,</l>
            <l>To be taught to fear god and theyr parents obey</l>
            <l>To get learning and qualities, thereby to maintain</l>
            <l>An honest quiet lyfe, correspondent alway,</l>
            <l>To gods law and the kynges, for it is certayne.</l>
            <l>If chyldren be noseled in idlenes and yll,</l>
            <l>And brought vp therin, it is hard to restrayne,</l>
            <l>And draw them from naturall wont euyll,</l>
            <l>As here in thys Interlude, ye shall se playne.</l>
            <l>By two chyldren brought vp wantonly in play,</l>
            <l>Whom y^e mother doth excuse, whē she should chastise</l>
            <l>They delyte in daliaunce and mischief alway,</l>
            <l>At last they ende theyr lyues in miserable wyse.</l>
            <l>The mother perswaded by worldly shame,</l>
            <l>That she was the cause of theyr wretched lyfe,</l>
            <l>So pensife, so sorowfull, for theyr death, she became,</l>
            <l>That in despaire she would ●lea her sel● wi●h a kinfe</l>
            <l>Then her sonne Barnabas, (by interpretacyon,</l>
            <l>The sonne of comfort,) her yll purpose do stay,</l>
            <l>By the scriptures he geueth her godly consolation</l>
