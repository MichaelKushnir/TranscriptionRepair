            <head>The Prologue at the black Friers.</head>
            <p>_THey that feare the flinging of Waspes make fannes of Peacokes tailes, whose spots are like eies. And <hi>Lepidus,</hi> which coulde not sleepe for the chattinge of birdes, set vp a beaste, whose head was like a Dragon: and we which stande in awe of reporte, are compelled to sette beefore our owle <hi>Pallas</hi> shield, thinking by her vertue to couer the others deformitie. It was a signe of famine to Aegypte, when <hi>Nylus</hi> flowed lesse then twelue Cubittes, or more then eighteene, and it may threaten dispaire vnto vs, if wee be lesse curious then you looke for, or more cumbersome. But as <hi>Theseus</hi> being promised to bee brought to an Ea|gles neast, and trauailing all the day, found but a wrenne in a hedg, yet said, this is a bird: so we hope, if the shower of our swelling mountaine seeme to bring forth some Eliphant, perfourme but a mouse, you will gently saye, this is a beast? Basill softly touched, yeeldeth a sweete sent, but chafed in the hande, a ranke sauour. Wee feare euen so that our labours slylye glaunced on, will breede some content, but examined to the proofe, small com|mendation. The haste in perfourming shall be our ex|cuse, There went two nightes to the begetting of <hi>Her|cules.</hi> Feathers appeare not on the Phoenix vnder seauen monethes, and the Mulbery is twelue in buddinge, but our trauailes are like the Hares, who at one time brin|geth forth, nourisheth, and engendreth againe, or like the broode of <hi>Trasbylus,</hi> whose egges in the same mo|ment
<pb facs="3"/>
that they are layd, become birdes. But howsoeuer we finish our worke, we craue pardō, if we offend in mat|ter, and patience if we transgresse in manners. Wee haue mixed mirth with counsell, and discipline with delight, thinking it not amisse in the same garden to sowe pot|hearbes, that we set flowers. But wee hope, as Harts that cast their hornes, Snakes their skinnes, Eagles their bils, become more fresh for any other labour: so our charge being shaken off, we shalbe fitte for greater matters. But least like the <hi>Mindyans,</hi> we make our gates greater then our towne, and that our play runnes out at the preface, we here conclude: wishing that although there bee in your precise iudgementes an vniuersall mislike, yet wee maye enjoy by your woonted curtesies a generall silēce.</p>

            <head>The Prologue at the Court.</head>
            <p>WEe are ashamed that our birde, which fluttered by twilight seeming a Swan, should be proued a Batte sette against the sunne. But as <hi>Iupiter</hi> placed <hi>Silenus</hi> Asse among the starres, and <hi>Alcebiades</hi> couered his pictures being Owles and Apes, with a courtaine embroidered with Lyons and Eagles, so are we enforced vpon a rough discourse to draw on a smooth excuse, resbling Lapida|ries, who thinke to hide the cracke in a stone by setting it deepe in golde. The Gods supped once with poore <hi>Baucis,</hi> the Persian kinges sometimes shaued stickes, our hope is your heighnesse will at this time lend an eare to ●n idle pastime. <hi>Appion</hi> raising <hi>Homere</hi> from hell, demā|ded onely who was his father, and we calling <hi>Alexander</hi> from his graue, seeke onely who was his loue. Whatsoe|uer we present, we wish it may be thought the daunsing of <hi>Agrippa</hi> his shadowes, who in the moment they were seene, were of any shape one woulde conceiue: or <hi>Lynces,</hi> who hauing a quicke fight to discerne, haue a short me|morie to forgette. With vs it is like to fare, as with these torches, which giuing light to others, consume them|selues, and wee shewing delight to others, shame our selues.

For as the moone can borrow no|thing els of the sunne but light, so of a fire, in whome nothing but vertue was, what coulde the childe receiue but singuler? It is for Turkes to staine each other, not for <hi>Dyamordes,</hi> in the one to bee made a difference in goodnes, in the other no comparison.</p>

                  <p>Fortune, thou didst neuer yet deceiue vertue, because vertue neuer yet did trust fortune. Sworde and fire will neuer get spoile, where wisdome and fortitude beares sway. O <hi>Thebes,</hi> thy walles were raysed by the sweetenesse of the harpe, but rased by the shrilnes of the trumpet. <hi>Alexander</hi> had neuer come so neere the wals, had <hi>Epaminondas</hi> walkt about the walles, and yet might the <hi>Thebanes</hi> haue beene mery in their streetes, if he had beene to watch their towers. But destinie is seldome foreseene, neuer preuented. We are heere now captiues, whose neckes are yoaked by force, but whose hearts can not yeelde by death.

                  <p>I had neuer such adoe to warne schollers to come before a king: First, I came to <hi>Crisippus</hi> a tall leane old mad man, willing him presently to appeare before <hi>Alexander,</hi> he stoode staring on my face, neither mouing his eies nor his body, I vrging him to giue some answer, hee tooke vp a booke, sate downe and saide nothing: <hi>Melissa</hi> his maid told mee it was his maner, and that of|tētimes she was fain to thrust meate in to his mouth: for that he wold rather starue thē ceasse studie. Wel thoght I, seeing bookish men are so blockish, &amp; so great clearkes such simple courtiers, I will neither be partaker of their cōmons nor their commēdations. Frō thence I came to <hi>Plato</hi> and to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and to diuerse other none refusing to come, sauing an old obscure fellowe, who sitting in a tub turned towardes the sonne, read Greek to a young boy, him when I willed to appeare before <hi>Alexander,</hi> he answered, if <hi>Alexander</hi> would faine see me, let him come to me, if learne of mee, lette him come to me, whatsoe|uer it be, let him come to me: why, said I, he is a king, hee answered, why I am a Philosopher, why, but he is <hi>Alex|ander,</hi> I but I am <hi>Diogenes.</hi> I was halfe angry to see one so crooked in his shape, to be so crabbed in his sayinges. So going my way, I said thou shalt repent it, if thou cōmest not to <hi>Alexander</hi>: nay, smiling answered hee, <hi>Alexander</hi> may repent it, if he come not to <hi>Diogenes:</hi> vertue must be sought, not offered: and so turning himself to his cell, he grunted I know not what, like a pig vnder a tub.

                  <p>I cannot tell <hi>Alexander,</hi> whether the reporte be more shamefull to be heard, or the cause sorowfull to be beleeued? What, is the sonne of <hi>Phillip,</hi> king of Mace|don become the subiect of <hi>Campaspe,</hi> the captiue of <hi>The|bes?</hi> Is that minde, whose greatnes the world coulde not containe, drawn within the compasse of an idle alluring eie? Wil you handle the spindle with <hi>Hercules,</hi> when you shuld shake the speare with <hi>Achilles?</hi> Is the warlike sound of drumme and trumpe turned to the softe noyse of lire and lute, the neighing of barbed steedes, whose loudnes filled the ayre with terrour, and whose breathes dim|med the sunne with smoake, conuerted to delicate tunes and amorous glaunces? O <hi>Alexander,</hi> that soft and yeel|ding minde should not bee in him, whose hard and vn|conquered heart hath made so many yeelde. But you loue, ah griefe, but whom? <hi>Campaspe,</hi> ah shame, a maide forsooth vnknowne, vnnoble; and who can tell whether immodest? whose eies are framed by arte to inamour, and whose heart was made by nature to enchaunt. I, but she is bewtiful, yea, but not therefore chaste: I, but she is comly in al partes of the body: yea, but she may be croo|ked in some parte of the mind; I, but she is wise, yea, but she is a woman: Bewtie is like the blackberry, which see|meth red, when it is not ripe resembling pretious stones that are polished with honney, which the smother they look, the sooner they breake. It is thought wonderful a|mong the sea men that <hi>Mugil</hi> of all fishes the swifteste is found in the belly of the <hi>Bret</hi> of all the slowest; And shal it not seeme monstrous to wise men, that the hearte of the greatest conquerour of the worlde, should be found
<pb facs="12"/>
in the handes of the weakest creature of nature? of a woman? of a captiue? <hi>Hermyns</hi> haue faire skinnes, but fowle liuers; Sepulcher's fresh colours but rotten bones, women faire faces, but false heartes. Remember <hi>Alex|ander</hi> thou haste a campe to gouerne, not a chamber, fall not from the armour of <hi>Mars</hi> to the armes of <hi>Venus,</hi> frō the fiery assaults of warre, to the maidenly skirmishes of loue from displaying the Eagle in thine ensigne, to sette downe the sparrow. I sigh <hi>Alexander</hi> that where fortune could not counquer, folly should ouercome. But behold al the perfection that may be in <hi>Campaspe,</hi> a haire curling by nature, not arte: sweete alluring eies, a faire face made in despite of <hi>Venus</hi>; and a stately porte in disdaine of <hi>ia|●●,</hi> a witte apt to conceaue, and quick to aunswere a skin as softe as silke, and as smooth as iet, a long white hand, a fine little foote, to conclude, all partes aunswerable to the best part, what of this? Though she haue heauenlye gifts, vertue and bewtie, is she not of earthly mettal flesh and bloud? You <hi>Alexander</hi> that would be a God, shewe your self in this worse then a man, so soone to bee both ouerseene and ouertaken in a woman, whose false teares know their true times, whose smooth wordes wounde deeper then sharpeswordes. There is no surfeit so dan|gerous, as that of honeye, nor any poyson so deadly, as that of loue, in the one phisicke cannot preuaile, nor in the other counsel.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Alex.</speaker>
                  <p>My case were light <hi>Hephestion,</hi> and notwor|thy to be called loue, if reason were a remedie, or sentē|ses could salue, that sense cannot conceaue, Litle do you know, and therefore sleightly doe you regard the dead embers in a priuate perso, or liue coles in a great prince, whose passions and thoughts do as farre exceede others in extremitie, as their callinges doe in Maiestie. An E|clipse in the Sunne is more then the fallinge of a starre, none can conceiue the tormentes of a king, vnlesse hee be a king; whose desires are not inferiour to their digni|ties.
<pb facs="12"/>
And then iudge <hi>Hephestion</hi> if the agonies of loue be dangerous in a subiect, whether they be not more then deadly vnto <hi>Alexander,</hi> whose deep and not to be con||ceiued sighes, cleaue the heart in shiuers, whose woun|ded thoughtes can neither be expressed nor endured. Cease then <hi>Hephestion</hi> with argumentes to seeke to refel that, which with their deitie the Gods cannot resist, and let this suffice to aunswere thee, that it is a king that lo|ueth and <hi>Alexander,</hi> whose affections are not to be mea|sured by reason, being immortall, nor I feare me to bee borne being intollerable.</p>

yet must the heare of her head be yellowe: the attire of her head must be different from the habite of her body, els would the picture seeme like the blason of auncient Armorie, not like the sweete delight of new found ami|ablenes. For as in garden knottes diuersitie of odours make a more sweete sauour, or as in musicke diuers stringes cause a more delicate consent, so in painting, the more colours, the better counterfeit, obseruing blacke for a ground, and the rest for grace.</p>

Yes, yes <hi>Apelles,</hi> thou maist smimme against the streame with the Crab, and feede againste the winde with the deere, and pecke against the steele with the Cockatrice: starres are to be looked at, not reached at.

Blush <hi>Venus,</hi> for I am ashamed to end thee. Now must I paint things vnpossible for mine arte, but agreeable with my affections: deepe and hollowe sighes, sadde and melancholye thoughtes, woundes and slaughters of conceites, a life posting to death, a death galloping from life, a wauering constancie, an vnsetled resolution, and what not, <hi>Apelles?</hi> And what but <hi>Apelles?</hi> But as they that are shaken with a feuer are to bee war|med with clothes, not groanes, and as he that melteth in

a consumptiō is to be recured by Colices, not conceits: so the feeding canker of my care, the neuer dying worm of my heart, is to be killed by counsel, not cries, by ap|plying of remedies, not by replying of reasons. And sith in cases desperat there must be vsed medicines y^t are ex|treame, I will hazard that litle life that is left, to restore the greater part that is lost, and this shalbe my first pra|ctise: for wit must worke, where authoritie is not. As|soone as <hi>Alexander</hi> hath viewed this portraiture, I will by deuise giue it a blemishe, that by that meanes shee maye come againe to my shop, and then as good it were to vt|ter my loue, and die with deniall, as conceale it and liue in despaire.</p>

Yee tearme mean hater of menne: no, I am a hater of your māers. Your liues dissolute, not fearing death, wil proue your deaths desperate, not hoping for life. What do you els in Athens but sleepe in the daye, and surfeite in the night: back Gods in the morning with pride, in the e|uening belly Gods with gluttony. You flatter kings, &amp; call them Gods, speak trueth of your selues, and cōfesse you are deuils. From the Bee you haue takē not the ho|ney, but the wax to make your religion, framing it to the time, not to the trueth. Your filthy lust you colour vnder a courtly colour of loue, iniuries abroad vnder the title of pollicies at home, &amp; secrete malice creepeth vnder the name of publike iustice. You haue caused <hi>Alexander</hi> to dry vp springs and plant vines, to sow roket and weede endisse, to sheare sheepe, and shrine foxes. All conscience is sealed at Athens. Swearing commeth of a hot mettle: lying of a quick wit: flattery of a flowing tong, vndecent talk of a mery disposition. Al things are lawful at Athēs. Either you think there are no Gods, or I must think yee are no men. You build as though you shoulde liue for e|uer, and surfeit as though you should die tomorow.

Hath a painter crept further into thy mind then a prince? <hi>Apel|les</hi> then <hi>Alexander?</hi> Fond wench, the basenes of thy mind bewraies the meannesse of thy birth. But alas, affection is a fire, which kindleth aswell in the bramble as in the oak, and catcheth hold where it first lighteth, not where it may best burne, Larkes that mount aloft in the ayre, build their neastes below in the earth, and women that cast their eies vpon kinges, may place their hearts vpon vassals. A needle will become thy fingers better then a lute, and a distasfe is fitter for thy hand then a scepter. Auntes liue safely, till they haue gotten winges, and Iu|niper is not blowne vp, till it hath gotten an high top. The mean estate is without care as long as it continu|eth without pride.

thy loue commeth from the hearte, but <hi>Alex|anders</hi> from the mouth. The loue of Kynges is lyke the blowinge of windes, whiche whistle sometimes gently amonge the leaues, and straight waies turne the trees vp by the rootes, or fire which warmeth a farre off, and burneth neere hand, or the sea, which maketh men hoyse their sayles in a flattering calme, and to cut their mastes in a rough storme. They place affection by times, by pollicie, by appointment, if they frowne, who dares call them vnconstant, if bewray secretes, who wil tearme them vntrue, if fall to other loues, who trembles not, if he call them vnfaithfull. In kinges there can be no loue, but to Queenes: for as neere must they meete in maie|stie, as they doe in affection. It is requisite to stande a|loofe from kings loue, <hi>loue,</hi> and lightening.</p>

If hee espy or but suspect, thou must needes twise perishe with his hate, and thine owne loue. Thy pale lookes, when he blushed, thy sadde countenaunce, when hee smyled, thy sighes, when he questioned, may breede in him a ielosie, perchaunce a frenzey. O loue, I neuer beefore knewe what thou wert, and nowe haste thou made mee that I know not what my self am? Onely this I knowe, that I must endure intollerable passions, for vnknowne plea|sures. Dispute not the cause wretch, but yeelde to it: for better it is to melt with desire, then wrastle with loue. Cast thy selfe on thy carefull bedde, be content to lyue vnknown, and die vnfounde. O <hi>Campaspe,</hi> I haue pain|ted thee in my hearte, paynted? nay, contrarye to mine arte, imprinted, and that in suche deepe Characters, that nothing can rase it out, vnlesse it rubbe thy hearte out.</p>

But as <hi>Demosthenes</hi> with often breathing vp the hill amended his stammering, so wee hope with sundry labours against the haire, to correcte our studies. If the tree be blasted that blossomes, the fault is in the wind, and not in the roote, and if our pa|stimes be misliked, that haue bin allowed, you must im|pute it to the malice of others, and not our endeuour. And so wee rest in good case if you rest well content.
