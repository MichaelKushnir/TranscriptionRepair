                  <p>_THou art a bountifull, and braue spring: and waterest all the no|ble plants of this <hi>Iland.</hi> In thee, the whole Kingdome dresseth it selfe, and is ambitious to vse thee as her glasse. Beware, then, thou render mens figures truly, and teach them no lesse to bate their deformities, then to loue their formes: For, to grace, there should come reuerence; and no man can call that louely, which is not also venerable. It is not pould'ring, perfuming, and euery day smelling of the taylor, that conuerteth to a beautiful obiect: but a mind, shining through any sute, which needes no false light either of riches, or honors to helpe it. Such shalt thou find some here, euen in the raigne of <hi>CYNTHIA</hi> (a <hi>CRITES,</hi> and an <hi>ARETE.</hi>) Now, vnder thy <hi>PHOEBVS,</hi> it will be thy prouince to make more: Except thou desirest to haue thy source mixe with the <hi>Spring</hi> of <hi>selfe-Loue,</hi> and so wilt draw vpon thee as welcome a discouery of thy dayes, as was then made of her nights.</p>

                        <p>First, the title of his play is CYNTHIAS <hi>Reuels,</hi> as any man (that hath hope to bee saued by his booke) can witnesse; the <hi>Scene,</hi> GARGA|PHIE: which I doe vehemently suspect for some sustian countrie, but let that vanish. Here, is the court of CYNTHIA, whither hee brings CV|PID (trauailing on foot) resolu'd to turne page. By the way, CVPID meetes with MERCVRIE, (as that's a thing to be noted, take anie of our play-bookes without a CVPID, or a MERCVRY in it, and burne it for an heretique in <hi>Poetrie</hi>)— Pray thee let me alone. MERCVRY, he (in the nature of a conjurer) raises vp ECCHO, who weepes ouer her loue, or Daffodill, NARCISSVS, a little; sings; curses the spring where|in the prettie foolish gentleman melted himselfe away: and ther's an end of her.—Now I am to informe you, that CVPID, and MERCVRY doe both become pages. CVPID attends on PHILAVTIA, or <hi>selfe-Loue,</hi> a court-ladie MERCVRY followes HEDON, the <hi>voluptuous,</hi> and a courtier; one that rankes himselfe euen with ANAIDES, or the <hi>impudent,</hi> a gallant, (and that's my part:) one that keepes <hi>laughter,</hi> GELAIA the daughter of <hi>folly,</hi> (a wench in boyes attire) to waite on him—These, in the court, meet with AMORPHVS, or the <hi>deformed</hi>; a trauailer that hath drunke of the fountaine, and there tels the wonders of the water. They presently dispatch away their pages with bottles to fetch of it, and them|selues goe to visite the ladies. But I should haue told you— (Looke, these emets put me out here) that with this AMORPHVS, there comes a|long a citizens heire, ASOTVS, or the <hi>prodigall,</hi> who (in imitation of the traueller, who hath the <hi>whetstone</hi> following him) entertaines the <hi>begger,</hi> to be his attendant.—Now, the <hi>Nymphs</hi> who are mistresses to these gal|lants, are PHILAVTIA, <hi>selfe-Loue</hi>; PHANTASTE, <hi>a light wittinesse</hi>; ARGV|RION <hi>monie</hi>; and their <hi>Guardian,</hi> mother MORIA; or mistresse <hi>folly.</hi>—</p>

Againe, that feeding their friends with nothing of their owne, but what they haue twice or thrice cook'd, they should not want only giue out, how soone they had drest it; nor how manie coaches came to carrie away the broken-meat, besides hobbie-horses, and foot|cloth nags.</p>

                        <p>Since I trode on this side the <hi>Alpes,</hi> I was not so frozen in my inuention. Let mee see: to accost him with some choice remnant of <hi>spa|nish,</hi> or <hi>italian?</hi> that would indifferently expresse my languages now: ma|rythen, if he should fall out to be ignorant, it were both hard, and harsh. How else? step into some <hi>ragioni del stato,</hi> and so make my induction? that were aboue him too; and out of his element, I feare. Faine to haue seene him in <hi>Venice,</hi> or <hi>Padua?</hi> or some face neere his in similitude? t'is too poin|ted, and open. No, it must be a more queint, and collaterall deuice. As— stay: to frame some <hi>encomiastick</hi> speech vpon this our <hi>Metropolis,</hi> or the wise magistrates thereof, in which politique number, 'tis ods, but his fa|ther fill'd vp a roome? descend into a particular admiration of their iu|stice; for the due measuring of coales, burning of cannes, and such like?
<pb n="194" facs="109"/>
As also their religion, in pulling downe a superstitious crosse, and aduan|cing a VENVS, or PRIAPVS, in place of it? ha? 'twill doe well. Or to talke of some hospitall, whose walls record his father a <hi>Benefactor?</hi> or of so many buckets bestow'd on his parish church, in his life time, with his name at length (for want of armes) trickt vpon them? Any of these? Or to praise the cleannesse of the street, wherein hee dwelt? or the proui|dent painting of his posts against hee should haue beene <hi>Praetor?</hi> or (lea|uing his parent) come to some speciall ornament about himselfe, as his rapier, or some other of his accoutrements? I haue it: Thanks, gracious MINERVA.</p>

He is not lightly within to his mercer, no, though he come when he takes physicke, which is commonly after his play. He beates a tailour very well, but a stocking-seller admirably: and so consequently any one hee owes monie too, that dares not resist him. Hee neuer makes generall in|ui●ement, but against the publishing of a new sute, marie then, you shall haue more drawne to his lodging, then come to the lanching of some three ships; especially if he be furnish'd with supplies for the retyring of his old ward-robe from pawne: if not, he do's hire a stocke of apparell, and some fortie, or fiftie pound in gold, for that fore-noone to shew. He's thought a verie necessarie perfume for the presence, and for that onely cause wel|come thither: sixe millaners shops affoord you not the like sent. He courts ladies with how many great horse he hath rid that morning, or how oft he hath done the whole, or the halfe <hi>pommado</hi> in a seuen-night before: and sometime venters so farre vpon the vertue of his pomander, that he dares tell'hem, how many shirts he has sweat at <hi>tennis</hi> that weeke, but wisely conceales so many dozen of bals hee is on the score. Here hee comes, that is all this.</p>

                        <p>Troth no; he has two essentiall parts of the courtier, pride, and ignorance; mary, the rest come somewhat after the <hi>ordinarie</hi> gallant. Tis <hi>impudence</hi> it selfe, ANAIDES; one, that speakes all that comes in his checkes, and will blush no more then a sackbut. Hee lightly occupies the iesters roome at the table, and keepes <hi>laughter</hi> GELAIA (a wench in pages attire) following him in place of a squire, whom he now and then tickles with some strange ridiculous stuffe, vtter'd (as his land came to him) by chance. He will censure or discourse of any thing, but as absurdly as you would wish. His fashion is not to take knowledge of him that is beneath him in clothes. Hee neuer drinkes below the salt. Hee do's naturally ad|mire his wit, that weares gold-lace, or tissue. Stabs any man that speakes more contemptibly of the scholler then he. Hee is a great proficient in all the illiberall sciences, as cheating, drinking, swaggering, whoring, and such like: neuer kneeles but to pledge healths; nor prayes but for a pipe of pudding tabacco. He wil blaspheme in his shirt. The othes which hee vomits at one supper, would maintaine a towne of garrison in good swea|ring a twelue-moneth. One other genuine qualitie he has, which crownes all these, and that is this: to a friend in want, hee will not depart with the waight of a soldred groat, lest the world might censure him prodigall, or report him a gull: mary, to his <hi>cockatrice</hi> or <hi>punquetto,</hi> halfe a dozen taffata

                        <speaker>MER.</speaker>
                        <p>O, what a masse of benefit shall we possesse, in being the inui|sible spectators of this strange shew, now to be acted?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>AMO.</speaker>
                        <p>Plant your selfe there, sir: and obserue me. You shall now, as well be the ocular, as the eare-witnesse, how cleerly I can refell that <hi>para|dox,</hi> or rather <hi>pseudodox,</hi> of those, which hold the face to be the index of the mind, which (I assure you) is not so, in any politique creature: for in|stance. I will now giue you the particular, and distinct face of euery your most noted <hi>species</hi> of persons, as your marchant, your scholer, your soul|dier, your lawyer, courtier, &amp;c. and each of these so truly, as you would sweare, but that your eye shal see the variation of the lineament, it were my most proper, and genuine aspect. First, for your marchant, or citie-face, 'tis thus, a dull, plodding face, still looking in a direct line, forward: there is no great matter in this face. Then haue you your students, or <hi>a|cademique</hi> face, which is here, an honest, simple, and methodicall face: but somewhat more spread then the former. The third is your souldiers face, a menacing, and astounding face, that lookes broad, and bigge: the grace of this face consisteth much in a beard. The <hi>anti-face</hi> to this, is your lawyers face, a contracted, subtile, and intricate face, full of quirkes, and turnings, a <hi>labyrinthaean</hi> face, now angularly, now circularly, euery way aspected. Next is your statists face, a serious, solemne, and supercilious face, full of formall, and square grauitie, the eye (for the most part) deep|ly and artificially shadow'd: there is great iudgement required in the ma|king of this face. But now, to come to your face of faces, or courtiers face, tis of three sorts, according to our subdiuision of a courtier, elementarie, practique, and theorique. Your courtier theorique, is hee, that hath ar|riu'd to his fardest, and doth now know the court, rather by speculation, then practice; and this is his face: a fastidious and oblique face, that lookes, as it went with a vice, and were screw'd thus. Your courtier pra|ctike, is he, that is yet in his path, his course, his way, &amp; hath not toucht the <hi>puntilio,</hi> or point of his hopes; his face is here: a most promising, open,
<pb n="202" facs="113"/>
smooth, and ouer-flowing face, that seemes as it would runne, and powre it selfe into you. Somewhat a northerly face. Your courtier elementarie, is one but newly enter'd, or as it were in the <hi>alphabet,</hi> or <hi>vt-re-mi-fa-sol-la</hi> of courtship. Note well this face, for it is this you must practice.</p>

                        <p>I, hereafter you may: and it will not be altogether an vngrate|full study. For, let your soule be assur'd of this (in any ranke, or professi|on what-euer) the more generall, or <hi>maior</hi> part of opinion goes with the face, and (simply) respects nothing else. Therefore, if that can be made exactly, curiously, exquisitely, thorowly, it is inough: But (for the pre|sent) you shall only apply your selfe to this face of the elementarie cour|tier, a light, reuelling, and protesting face, now blushing, now smiling, which you may helpe much with a wanton wagging of your head, thus, (a feather will teach you) or with kissing your ●inger that hath the ruby, or playing with some string of your band, which is a most quaint kind of melancholy besides: or (if among ladies) laughing lowd, and crying vp your owne wit, though perhaps borrow'd, it is not amisse. Where is your page? call for your casting-bottle, and place your mirrour in your hat, as I told you: so. Come, looke not pale, obserue me, set your face, and enter.</p>

                        <p>A notable smelt. One, that hath newly entertain'd the begger to follow him, but cannot get him to wait neere enough. T'is ASOTVS, the heire of PHILARGYRVS; but first I'le giue yee the others character, which may make his the cleerer. He that is with him, is AMORPHVS, a trauailer, one so made out of the mixture and shreds of formes, that himselfe is truly deform●d. He walkes most commonly with a cloue, or pick-tooth in his mouth, hee is the very mint of complement, all his be|hauiours are printed, his face is another volume of <hi>essayes</hi>; and his beard an <hi>Aristarchus.</hi> He speakes all creame, skimd, and more affected then a dozen of waiting women. He is his owne promoter in euery place. The wife of the ordinarie giues him his diet, to maintaine her table in discourse, which (indeed) is a meere tyrannie ouer her other guests, for hee will v|surpe all the talke: ten constables are not so tedious. He is no great shifter, once a yeere his apparell is readie to reuolt. He doth vse much to arbitrate quarrels, and fights himselfe, exceeding well (out at a window.) He will
<pb n="203" facs="113"/>
lye cheaper then any begger, and lowder then most clockes: for which he is right properly accommodated to the <hi>whetstone,</hi> his page. The other gal|lant is his <hi>Zani,</hi> and doth most of these trickes after him; sweates to imi|tate him in euery thing (to a haire) except a beard, which is not yet ex|tant. He doth learne to make strange sauces, to eat <hi>aenchouies, maccaroni, bo|uoli, fagioli,</hi> and <hi>cauiare,</hi> because hee loues 'hem; speakes as hee speakes, lookes, walkes, goes so in clothes, and fashion: is in all, as if he were moul|ded of him. Mary (before they met) he had other verie prettie sufficien|cies, which yet he retaines some light impression of: as frequenting a dan|cing schoole, and grieuously torturing strangers, with inquisition after his grace in his galliard. He buyes a fresh acquaintance at any rate. His eye and his rayment confer much together as he goes in the street. He treades nicely, like the fellow that walkes vpon ropes; especially the first <hi>sunday</hi> of his silke-stockings: and when he is most neat, and new, you shall strip him with commendations.</p>

                        <p>CRITES. A creature of a most perfect and diuine temper. One, in whom the humours and elements are peaceably met, without emulati|on of precedencie: he is neyther to phantastikely melancholy, too slowly phlegmaticke, too lightly sanguine, or too rashly cholericke, but in all, so composde &amp; order'd, as it is cleare, <hi>Nature</hi> went about some ful worke, she did more then make a man, when she made him. His discourse is like his behauiour, vncommon, but not vnpleasing; hee is prodigall of ney|ther. Hee striues rather to bee that which men call iudicious, then to bee thought so: and is so truly learned, that he affects not to shew it. Hee will thinke, and speake his thought, both freely: but as distant from deprauing another mans merit, as proclaiming his owne. For his valour, tis such, that he dares as little to offer an iniurie, as receiue one. In summe, he hath a most ingenuous and sweet spirit, a sharp and season'd wit, a straight iudg|ment, and a strong mind. <hi>Fortune</hi> could neuer breake him, nor make him lesse. He counts it his pleasure, to despise pleasures, and is more delighted with good deeds, then goods. It is a competencie to him that hee can bee vertuous. He doth neyther couet nor feare; hee hath too much reason to doe eyther: and that commends all things to him.</p>

A <hi>Nymph</hi> of a most wandring and giddy dispositi|on, humorous as the aire, shee'le runne from gallant to gallant (as they sit at <hi>primero</hi> in the presence) most strangely, and seldome stayes with any. Shee spreads as shee goes. To day you shall haue her looke as cleere and fresh as the morning, and to morrow as melancholike as mid-night. Shee takes speciall pleasure in a close obscure lodging, and, for that cause, visites the city so often, where shee has many secret true-concealing fauourites. When shee comes abroad, shee's more loose and scattering then dust, and will flie from place to place, as shee were rapt with a whirle-winde. Your yong student (for the most part) shee affects not, only salutes him, and a|way: a <hi>poet,</hi> nor a <hi>philosopher,</hi> shee is hardly brought to take any notice of; no, though he be some part of an <hi>alchemist.</hi> Shee loues a <hi>player</hi> well, and a <hi>lawyer</hi> infinitely: but your foole aboue all. Shee can doe much in court for the obtayning of any sute whatsoeuer, no doore but flies open to her, her presence is aboue a charme. The worst in her is want of keeping state, and too much descending into inferior and base offices, she's for any coorse imployment you will put vpon her, as to be your procurer, or pandar.</p>

                        <p>Who I? Let me see now. I would wish to be a wise woman, and know all the secrets of court, citie, and countrie. I would know what were done behind the arras, what vpon the staires, what i' the garden, what i' the <hi>Nymphs</hi> chamber, what by barge, &amp; what by coach. I would tel you which courtier were scabbed, and which not; which ladie had her owne face to lie with her a-nights, &amp; which not; who put off their teeth with their clothes in court, who their haire, who their complexion; and in which boxe they put it. There should not a <hi>Nymph,</hi> or a widdow be got with childe i' the verge, but I would guesse (within one or two,) who was the right father: and in what moneth it was gotten; with what words; and which way. I would tell you, which Madame lou'd a <hi>Monsieur,</hi> which a player, which a page; who slept with her husband, who with her friend, who with her gentleman-vsher, who with her horse-keeper, who with her monkie, and who with all. Yes, and who jigg'd the cocke too.</p>

                        <p>Troth, the verie same I am. Onely I would wish my selfe a lit|tle more command, and soueraignetie; that all the court were subiect to my absolute becke, and all things in it depending on my looke; as if there were no other heauen, but in my smile, nor other hell, but in my frowne; that I might send for any man I list, and haue his head cut off, when I haue done with him; or made an <hi>eunuch,</hi> if he denyed mee: and if I saw a bet|ter
<pb n="220" facs="122"/>

                        <p>Faith, I cannot (readily) tell you what▪ But (mee thinkes) I should wish my selfe all manner of creatures. Now, I would bee an em|presse; and by and by a dutchesse; then a great ladie of state; then one of your <hi>miscelany</hi> madams; then a waiting-woman; then your cittizens wife; then a course countrey gentlewoman; then a deyrie maide; then a shepheards lasse; then an empresse againe, or the queene of <hi>fayries</hi>: And thus I would prooue the vicissitudes, and whirle of pleasures, about, and againe. As I were a shepheardesse, I would bee pip'd and sung too; as a deyrie wench, I would dance at <hi>may</hi>-poles, and make sillabubbes; As a countrey gentlewoman, keep a good house, and come vp to terme, to see motions; As a cittizens wife, bee troubled with a iealous husband, and put to my shifts; (others miseries should bee my pleasures) As a waiting-woman, I would taste my ladies delights to her; As a <hi>miscellany</hi> madame inuent new tyres, and goe visite courtiers; As a great ladie, lye a bed, and haue courtiers visite mee; As a dutchesse, I would keepe my state: and as an empresse, I'ld doe any thing. And, in all these shapes, I would euer bee follow'd with th' affections of all that see mee. Mary, I my selfe would af|fect none; or if I did, it should not bee heartily, but so as I might saue my selfe in 'hem still, and take pride in tormenting the poore wretches. Or, (now I thinke on't) I would, for one yeere, wish my selfe one woman, but the richest, fairest, and delicatest in a kingdome, the very center of wealth, and beautie, wherein all lines of loue should meet; and in that person I would prooue all manner of suters, of all humours, and of all complexi|ons, and neuer haue any two of a sort: I would see how <hi>Loue</hi> (by the po|wer of his object) could worke inwardly alike, in a cholericke man, and a sanguine; in a melancholique, and a phlegmatique; in a foole, and a wise man; in a clowne, and a courtier; in a valiant man, and a coward: and how he could varie outward, by letting this gallant expresse himselfe in dumbe gaze; another with sighing, and rubbing his fingers; a third, with play-ends, and pittifull verses; a fourth, with stabbing himselfe, and drinking healths, or writing languishing letters in his bloud; a fifth, in colour'd ribbands, and good clothes; with this lord to smile, and that lord to court, and the t'other lord to do●e, and one lord to hang himselfe. And then, I to haue a booke made of all this, which I would call the booke of humours, and euery night reade a little piece, ere I slept, and laugh at it. Here comes HEDON.</p>

                        <p>Yes, there is the note; and all the parts if I mis-thinke not. I will read the dittie to your beauties here, but first I am to make you fami|liar with the occasion, which presents it selfe thus. Vpon a time, going to take my leaue of the Emperour, and kisse his great hands; there being then present, the kings of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Arragon,</hi> the dukes of <hi>Sauoy, Flo|rence▪ Orbeance, Bourbon, Brunswicke,</hi> the <hi>Lantgraue, Count Palatine,</hi> all which had seuerally feasted me; besides, infinite more of inferiour persons, as Counts and others it was my chance the Emperour detain'd by some ex|orbitant affaire) to wait him the fift part of an houre, or much neere it. In which time (retyring my selfe into a bay-window) the beauteous ladie ANNABELL, neece to the Empresse, and sister to the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> who hauing neuer before eyde mee, (but only heard the common report of my vertue, learning, and trauaile) fell into that extremitie of passion, for my loue, that shee there immediately swouned: physicians were sent for, she had to her chamber, so to her bed; where (languishing some few daies) after many times calling vpon me, with my name in her lips, she expirde. As that (I must mourningly say) is the onely fault of my fortune, that, as it hath euer beene my hap to be sew'd to, by all ladies, and beauties, where I haue come, so, I neuer yet sojourn'd, or rested in that place, or part of the world, where some high-borne admirable faire feature died not for my loue.</p>

You seeing him, close in her eare, with this whisper (here comes your <hi>Babion,</hi> disgrace him) and withall, stepping off, fall on his bosome, and turning to her, politiquely, aloud say, ladie, reguard this noble gentleman, a man rarely parted, second to none in this court; and then, stooping ouer his shoulder, your hand on his brest, your mouth on his back-side, you giue him the <hi>Reuerse</hi> stroke, with this <hi>Sanna,</hi> or Storkes-bill, which makes vp your wits <hi>Bob,</hi> most bitter.</p>

And, for your spectators, you behold them, what they are: The most choice particulars in court: This tels tales well; This prouides coaches; This repeates iests; This presents gifts▪ This holds vp the arras; This takes downe from horse; This protests by this light; This sweares by that candle; This delighteth; This adoreth. Yet, all but three men.

                        <p>CLeare pearle of heauen, and, not to bee farther ambitious in titles, CYNTHIA. The same of this illustrous night, among others, hath also drawne these foure faire virgins from the palace of their Queene <hi>Perfection</hi> (a word▪ which makes no sufficient difference, twixt hers, and thine) to visit thy imperiall court: for she, their soueraigne, not finding where to dwell among men, before her returne to heauen, aduised them wholy to consecrate themselues to thy celestiall seruice, as in whose cleere spirit (the proper element, and sphere of vertues) they should behold not her alone, (their euer honour'd mistris) but themselues (more truly them|selues) to liue inthroniz'd. Her selfe would haue commended them vnto thy fauour more particularly, but that shee knowes no commendation is more auaileable with them, then that of proper vertue. Neuerthelesse, she will'd them to present this christall <hi>mound,</hi> a note of monarchie, and symbole of perfection, to thy more worthie <hi>deitie</hi>; which, as heere by me they most humbly doe, so amongst the rarities thereof, that is the chiefe, to shew whatsoeuer the world hath excellent, howsoeuer remote and va|rious. But your irradiate iudgement will soone discouer the secrets of this little cristall world. Themselues (to appeare more plainely) because they know nothing more odious, then false pretexts, haue chosen to expresse
<pb n="258" facs="142"/>
their seuerall qualities, thus, in seuerall colours.</p>
                        <p>The first, in citron colour, is <hi>naturall Affection,</hi> which giuen vs to procure our good, is somtime called STORGE, &amp; as euery one is neerest to himselfe, so this hand-maid of reason, <hi>allowable selfe-loue,</hi> as it is without harme, so are none without it: Her place in the court of <hi>Perfection</hi> was to quic|ken mindes in the pursuit of honour. Her deuice is a <hi>perpendicular Leuell,</hi> vpon a <hi>Cube,</hi> or <hi>Square.</hi> The word, SE SVO MODVLO. Alluding to that true measure of ones selfe, which as euerie one ought to make, so is it most conspicuous in thy diuine example.</p>
                        <p>The second, in greene, is AGLAIA, <hi>delectable and pleasant Conuersati|on,</hi> whose propertie is to moue a kindly delight, and sometime not with|out laughter: Her office, to entertaine assemblies, and keepe societies to|gether with faire familiaritie. Her deuice within <hi>a Ring of clouds, a Heart with shine about it.</hi> The word, CVRARVM NVEILA PELLO. An <hi>alle|gorie</hi> of CYNTHIAES light, which no lesse cleares the skie, then her faire mirth the heart.</p>
                        <p>The third, in the discolour'd mantle spangled all ouer, is EVPHANTAS|TE, <hi>a well conceited Wittinesse,</hi> and imployd in honouring the court with the riches of her pure inuention. Her deuice, vpon a <hi>Petasus,</hi> or <hi>Mercuriall</hi> hat, a <hi>Crescent.</hi> The word, SIC LAVS INGENII. Inferring, that the praise and glorie of wit, doth euer increase, as doth thy growing moone.</p>
                        <p>The fourth in white, is APHELEIA, a <hi>Nymph</hi> as pure and simple as the soule, or as an abrase table, and is therefore called <hi>Simplicitie,</hi> without folds, without pleights, without colour, without counterfeit: and (to speake plainly) <hi>Plainenesse</hi> it selfe. Her deuice is no deuice. The word vn|der her <hi>siluer Shield,</hi> OMNIS ABEST FVCVS. Alluding to thy spotlesse selfe, who art as farre from impuritie, as from mortalitie.</p>
                        <p>My selfe (celestiall Goddesse) more fit for the court of CYNTHIA, then the arbors of CYTHEREE, am call'd ANTEROS, or <hi>Loues enemie</hi>; the more welcome therefore to thy court, and the fitter to conduct this <hi>quaternion,</hi> who as they are thy professed votaries, and for that cause aduersaries to <hi>Loue,</hi> yet thee (perpetuall <hi>Virgin</hi>) they both loue, and vow to loue eter|nally.</p>

                        <p>SIster of PHOEBVS, to whose bright orbe we owe, that we not com|plaine of his absence; These foure brethren (for they are brethren, and sonnes of EVTAXIA, a lady knowne, and highly belou'd of your resplendent <hi>deitie</hi>) not able to be absent, when CYNTHIA held a solem|nitie, officiously insinuate themselues into thy presence: For, as there are foure cardinall vertues, vpon which the whole frame of the <hi>court</hi> doth moue, so are these the foure cardinall properties, without which, the body of <hi>complement</hi> moueth not. With these foure siluer iauelins (which they beare in their hands) they support in Princes courts the state of the pre|sence, as by office they are obliged; which, though here they may seeme superfluous, yet, for honors sake, they thus presume to visite thee, hauing also beene emploid in the palace of Queene <hi>Perfection.</hi> And though to them, that would make themselues gracious to a Goddesse, sacrifices were fitter then presents, or <hi>Impreses,</hi> yet they both hope thy fauour; and (in place of either) vse seuerall <hi>Symboles,</hi> contayning the titles of thy impe|riall dignitie.</p>
                        <p>First, the hethermost, in the changeable blew, and greene robe, is the commendably-fashioned gallant, EVCOSMOS; whose courtly habite is the grace of the presence, and delight of the surueying eye: whom ladies vnderstand by the names of <hi>neate,</hi> and <hi>elegant.</hi> His <hi>symbole</hi> is, DIVAE VIRGINI, in which he would expresse thy <hi>deities</hi> principall glory, which hath euer beene <hi>virginitie.</hi>

                        <p>The second, in the rich acoutrement, and robe of purple, empaled with gold, is EVPATHES; who entertaynes his mind with an harmelesse, but not incurious varietie: All the obiects of his senses are sumptuous, him|selfe a gallant, that, without excesse, can make vse of superfluitie: goe richly in imbroideries, iewells (and what not?) without vanitie, and fare delicately without gluttonie: and therefore not (not without cause) is vniuersally thought to be of <hi>fiue humour.</hi> His <hi>Symbole</hi> is, DIVAE OP|TIMAE. An attribute to expresse thy <hi>goodnesse,</hi> in which thou so resem|blest IOVE thy father.</p>
                        <p>The third, in the blush-colour'd sute, is, EVTOLMOS, as duely respe|cting others, as neuer neglecting himselfe; commonly knowne by the title of <hi>good as dacitie:</hi> to courts, and courtly assemblies, a guest most acceptable. His <hi>Symbole</hi> is, DIVAE VIRAGINI. To expresse thy <hi>hardy courage,</hi> in chase of sauage beasts, which harbour in woods, and wildernesse.</p>
                        <p>The fourth, in watchet tinsell, is the kind, and truly benefique EVCO|LOS. Who imparteth not without respect, but yet without difficultie; and hath the happinesse to make euery kindnesse seeme double, by the

timely, and freely bestowing thereof. He is the chiefe of them, who (by the vulgar) are said to be of <hi>good nature.</hi> His <hi>Symbole</hi> is, DIVAE MAXI|MAE. An adiunct to signifie thy <hi>greatnesse,</hi> which in heauen, earth, and hell is formidable.</p>

                  <l>I am turn'd rimer; and doe thus begin.</l>
                  <l>The Author (iealous, how your sense doth take</l>

                  <l>But if I yet know what, I am a rogue.</l>
                  <l>He ties me to such lawes, as quite distract</l>

                  <l>To craue your fauour, with a begging knee,</l>
                  <l>Were to distrust the writers facultie.</l>

                  <l>Stifly to stand on this, and proudly approue</l>
                  <l>The play, might taxe the maker of <hi>selfe-Loue.</hi>
