                                 <l>I'll prove it ſtrongly.</l>
                                 <l>He that ſteals corn, ſteals the bread of the Cōmon-wealth;</l>
                                 <l>He that ſteals a wench, ſteals but the fleſh.</l>

                              <sp>

                                 <p>And how is the bread ſtealing more criminall then the fleſh?</p>
                              </sp>
                              <sp>
                                 <speaker>Buſt.</speaker>
                                 <l>Hee that ſteals bread, ſteals that which is lawfull every day:</l>
                                 <l>He that ſteals fleſh, ſteals nothing from the faſting day:</l>
                                 <l>
                                    <hi>Ergo,</hi> To ſteal the bread is the arranter theft.</l>
                              </sp>
                              <sp>

                                 <l>Again, He that ſteals fleſh, ſteals for his own belly full:</l>
                                 <l>He that ſteals bread, robs the guts of others:</l>
                                 <l>
                                    <hi>Ergo,</hi> The arranter theef the bread-ſtealer.</l>
                                 <p>Again, He that ſteals fleſh, ſteals once, and gives over; yes, and often payes for it: the other ſteals every day, without ſatisfaction. To conclude, Bread-ſtealing is the more ca|pitall crime: for what he ſteals hee puts it in at the head: hee that ſteals fleſh (as the Dutch Author ſayes) puts it in at the foot, (the lower member.) Will you go as you are now, Miller?</p>
