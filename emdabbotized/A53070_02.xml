                     <p>You ſhall pardon me, there are ſets of them, as there are of Fidlers; there is firſt a ſet of Court Jeerers, ſpruce half-witted men, con|fident, and fierce in their opinions; theſe are men that make themſelves muſick, and their cloths make roome for their wic; and go before in all compa|nies: Then there is the town Jeerers, like Ho|boyes or Waites of the City, that think they are wiſe when they are loud, and make a noiſe when they come to Plaies, to diſtract the next mans underſtanding. There are Jeerers at time of the yeer that go down into the Countrey, and in|fect Wakes, and Faires, and the Sizes, with their impudence, with which they ſave charges, and are never without the name of a great Lord, to whom they are coſin Germane.</p>

Then for your oaths, I proteſt is out of faſhion, I profeſſe for a Juſtice of Peaces Wiſe, I vow too maſculine, yfaith for a Chambermaid, Introth for a Landerer, As you hope to live, too like a Prayer; Never ſtir, would diſadvantage a Lady many waies, beſides viſits; For the active wenches of the time, May they be damn'd eternally, and loſe all their deſigns if it be not ſo; Upon my honour ſounds well, which in a great Lady can never be forfeited if ſhe be in love, for great women have their privilege of Nobility, and can never be forſworn like the Com|mon people.</p>
