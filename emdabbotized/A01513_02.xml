and Musickes before euery Acte.</head>
               <p>_FIrst, before the beginning of the firste
Acte, did sounde a dolefull and straunge
noyse of violles, Cythren, Bandurion,
and suche like, during the which, there
came in vpon the Stage a King with an Impe|riall
Crowne vpon his head, very richely appa|relled,
a Scepter in his right hande, a Mounde
with a Crosse in his left hande, sitting in a Cha|riote
very richely furnished, drawne in by foure
kinges in their Dublettes and Hosen, with
Crownes also vpon their heades: Representing
vnto vs Ambition, by the hystorie of <hi>Sesostres</hi>
king of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who beeing in his time and reigne
a mightie Conquerour, yet not content to haue
subdued many Princes, and taken from them
their kingdomes and dominions, did in lyke ma|ner
cause those Kinges whome he had so ouer|come,
to drawe in his Chariote like Beastes and
Oxen, thereby to content his vnbrideled ambi|tious
desire. After he had beene drawne twyce
about the Stage, and retyred, the Musicke cea|sed,
and <hi>Iocasta</hi> the Queene issued out of hir
house, beginning the first Acte, as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iocasta</hi> the Queene issueth out of hir Pallace,
before hir twelue Gentlemen very brauely appa|relled,
following after hir eight Gentlewomen,
<pb n="74" facs="38"/>
whereof foure be the <hi>Chorus</hi> that remayne on
the Stage after hir departure. At hir entrance
the Trumpettes sounded, and after she had
gone once aboute the Stage, she tur|neth
to one of hir moste trustie and
estemed seruaunts, and vnto him
she discloseth hir griefe,
as foloweth.</p>

sound a very doleful noise of flutes, during the

couered with hearce clothes▪ &amp; brought in by .viij.

mourners, &amp; after they had caried the coffins a|bout
the stage, there opened &amp; appeared a Graue,
wherin they buried the coffins &amp; put fire ●o them,
but the flames did seuer &amp; parte in twaine, signi|fying
discord by the history of two brethrē, whose
discord in their life was not onely to be wondred
at, but being buried both in one Tombe (as some
writers affirme) the flames of their funeralls did
yet part the one frō the other in like manner, and
would in no wise ioyne into one flame. After the
Funerals were ended and the fire consumed, the
graue was closed vp again, the mourners with|drew
thē off the stage, &amp; immediately by y^● gates
<hi>Homoloydes</hi> entred <hi>Pollinyces</hi> accompanied with
vj. gentlemen and a page that carried his helmet
and Target, he &amp; his men vnarmed sauing their
gorgets, for that they were permitted to come

a very dolefull noise of cornettes, during the

in their dublets and hose bringing vpō their shul|ders
baskets full of earth and threwe them into
the Gulfe to fill it vp, but it would not so close vp
nor be filled. Then came the ladyes and dames
that stoode by, throwing in their chey●es &amp; Ie|wels,
so to cause it stoppe vp and close it self, but
when it would not so be filled, came in a kinghte
with his sword drawen, armed at all poyntes,
who walking twise or thrise about it, &amp; perusing
if, seing that it would neither be filled with earth
nor with their Iewells and ornamentes, after
solempne reuerence done to the gods, and curte|ous
leaue taken of the Ladyes and standers by,
sodeinly lepte into the Gulfe the which did close
vp immediatly, bet●kening vnto vs the loue that
euery worthy person oweth vnto his natiue coū|trie,

               <p>BEfore the beginning of this fourth Acte, the
Trumpets sounded, the drummes and fifes,
and a greate peale of ordinaunce was shot of, in
the which ther entred vpon the stage .vj. knights
armed at al points, whereof three came in by the
Gates <hi>Electrae,</hi> and the other foure by the Gates
<hi>Homoloides,</hi> either parte beeing accompanied
<pb n="130" facs="66"/>
with vij, other armed men: and after they had
marched twice or thrice about the Stage, the
one partie menacing the other by their furious
lookes and gestures, the .vj. knights caused their
other attendants to stand by, and drawing their
Swords, fell to cruell and couragious combate,
continuing therein, till two on the one side were
slayne: the third perceiuing, that he only remay|ned
to withstand the force of .iij. enemies, did po|litiquely
runne aside, wherewith immediatly one
of the .iij. followed after him, and when he hadde
drawen his enimie thus from his companie, hee
turned againe and slewe him: Then the seconde
also ranne after him, whome he slewe in like mā|ner,
and consequently the thirde, and then trium|phantly
marched aboute the Stage with hys
sword in his hand. Hereby was noted the incom|parable
force of concord betweene brethren, who
as long as they holde togither may not easily by
any meanes be ouercome, and being once disseue|red
by any meanes, are easily ouerthrowen. The
history of the brethren <hi>Horatij</hi> &amp; <hi>Curiatij,</hi> who a|greed
to like combate and came to like ende. Af|ter
that the dead carkasses were caried from the
Stage by the armed men on both parties, and
that the victor was triumphantly accompanied
out, also came in a messanger armed from the
campe, seeking the Queene, and to hir spake as

               <p>FIrst the Stillpipes sounded a very mournfull

a womā clothed in a white garment, on hir head
a piller, double faced, the formost face fayre &amp; smi|ling,
the other behinde blacke &amp; louring, muffled
with a white laune about hir eyes, hir lap full of
Iewelles, sitting in a charyot, hir legges naked,
hir fete set vpō a great round ball, &amp; beyng drawē
in by .iiij. noble personages, she ledde in a string on
hir right hande .ij. kings crowned, and in hir lefte
hand .ij. poore slaues very meanely attyred. After
she was drawen about the stage, she stayed a lyt|tle,
changing the kings vnto the left hande &amp; the
slaues vnto the right hande, taking the crownes
from the kings heads she crowned therwith the
ij. slaues, &amp; casting the vyle clothes of the slaues
vppon the kings, she despoyled the kings of their
robes, and therwith aparelled the slaues. This
done, she was drawen eftsones about the stage in
this order, and then departed, leauing vnto vs
a plaine Type or figure of vnstable fortune, who
dothe oftentimes raise to heigthe of dignitie the
vile and vnnoble, and in like manner throweth
downe frō the place of promotiō, euen those whō
before she hir selfe had thither aduaunced: after
hir departure came in Duke <hi>Creon</hi> with foure
gentlemen wayting vpon him, and lamented the
death of <hi>Menec●us</hi> his sonne in this maner.</p>
