and Musickes before euery Acte.</head>
               <p>_FIrst, before the beginning of the firste
Acte, did sounde a dolefull and straunge
noyse of violles, Cythren, Bandurion,
and suche like, during the which, there
came in vpon the Stage a King with an Impe|riall
Crowne vpon his head, very richely appa|relled,
a Scepter in his right hande, a Mounde
with a Crosse in his left hande, sitting in a Cha|riote
very richely furnished, drawne in by foure
kinges in their Dublettes and Hosen, with
Crownes also vpon their heades: Representing
vnto vs Ambition, by the hystorie of <hi>Sesostres</hi>
king of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who beeing in his time and reigne
a mightie Conquerour, yet not content to haue
subdued many Princes, and taken from them
their kingdomes and dominions, did in lyke ma|ner
cause those Kinges whome he had so ouer|come,
to drawe in his Chariote like Beastes and
Oxen, thereby to content his vnbrideled ambi|tious
desire. After he had beene drawne twyce
about the Stage, and retyred, the Musicke cea|sed,
and <hi>Iocasta</hi> the Queene issued out of hir
house, beginning the first Acte, as followeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iocasta</hi> the Queene issueth out of hir Pallace,
before hir twelue Gentlemen very brauely appa|relled,
following after hir eight Gentlewomen,
<pb n="74" facs="38"/>
whereof foure be the <hi>Chorus</hi> that remayne on
the Stage after hir departure. At hir entrance
the Trumpettes sounded, and after she had
gone once aboute the Stage, she tur|neth
to one of hir moste trustie and
estemed seruaunts, and vnto him
she discloseth hir griefe,
as foloweth.</p>

in mourning weed, &amp; accoÌpanied with .viij. other
mourners, &amp; after they had caried the coffins a|bout
the stage, there opened &amp; appeared a Graue,
wherin they buried the coffins &amp; put fire âo them,
but the flames did seuer &amp; parte in twaine, signi|fying
discord by the history of two brethreÌ, whose
discord in their life was not onely to be wondred
at, but being buried both in one Tombe (as some
writers affirme) the flames of their funeralls did
yet part the one froÌ the other in like manner, and
would in no wise ioyne into one flame. After the
Funerals were ended and the fire consumed, the
graue was closed vp again, the mourners with|drew
theÌ off the stage, &amp; immediately by y^â gates
<hi>Homoloydes</hi> entred <hi>Pollinyces</hi> accompanied with
vj. gentlemen and a page that carried his helmet
and Target, he &amp; his men vnarmed sauing their

a very dolefull noise of cornettes, during the
which there opened and appeared in the stage a
great Gulfe, immediately came in .vj. gentlemen
in their dublets and hose bringing vpoÌ their shul|ders
baskets full of earth and threwe them into
the Gulfe to fill it vp, but it would not so close vp
nor be filled. Then came the ladyes and dames
that stoode by, throwing in their cheyâes &amp; Ie|wels,
so to cause it stoppe vp and close it self, but
when it would not so be filled, came in a kinghte
with his sword drawen, armed at all poyntes,
who walking twise or thrise about it, &amp; perusing
if, seing that it would neither be filled with earth
nor with their Iewells and ornamentes, after
solempne reuerence done to the gods, and curte|ous
leaue taken of the Ladyes and standers by,
sodeinly lepte into the Gulfe the which did close
vp immediatly, betâkening vnto vs the loue that
euery worthy person oweth vnto his natiue couÌ|trie,

in by .iiij. noble personages, she ledde in a string on
hir right hande .ij. kings crowned, and in hir lefte
hand .ij. poore slaues very meanely attyred. After
she was drawen about the stage, she stayed a lyt|tle,
changing the kings vnto the left hande &amp; the
slaues vnto the right hande, taking the crownes
from the kings heads she crowned therwith the
ij. slaues, &amp; casting the vyle clothes of the slaues
vppon the kings, she despoyled the kings of their
robes, and therwith aparelled the slaues. This
done, she was drawen eftsones about the stage in
