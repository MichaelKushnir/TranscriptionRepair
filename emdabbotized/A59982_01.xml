                  <head>TO THE
CANDID READER.</head>
                  <p>_A Small part of this Subject,
many years since had drop'd
from my pen: But looking
at some opportunities upon
the Argument, I thought some things
more considerable might be deduced;
and applying my self further, at times
of recess, I felt it grow and multiply un|der
my imagination: Nor left I it then
(the matter being so pregnant in it self)
till I form'd it into such limbs and pro|portions
as you now see it. Modesty
after this, invited me to cover it, and to
cut off many impertinences, and purge
some humour, that sa●e, I confess, un|handsomely
upon it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="3"/>
What is now presented, I hope will
appear a genuine and unforc'd Moral,
which though drest in Drammatique
Ornament, may not displease, in the
reading, persons of ingenuity, such whose
nature is not to create prejudice, where
they intend a recreation. And in the
confidence of that, I do not repent the
superstructures I have made, my pains,
nor expences that have attended to
bring it to this. It is now publique to
satisfie the importunity of friends, I
will onely adde, it is like to be the last,
for in my resolve, nothing of this nature
shall after this, engage either my pen or
invention.</p>
                  <p>The reason why I make no particu|lar
Dedication to any Friend, is, because
I aim my general respect to all, whose
favours and civilities have oblig'd me.
At this none will be offended, where
<pb facs="3"/>
none hath the precedence: And to con|clude
with the most serious truth, I
know not any, that love me so little,
whom the payment of my so mean ad|dresses
would satisfie, as to clear me up|on
the account of his friendship. Let
this suffice at present from him, that is</p>
