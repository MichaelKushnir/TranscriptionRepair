               <p>_HIPPOLYTVS, the Sonne of THE|SEVS
&amp; ANTIOPA Quene of the
<hi>Amazons,</hi> renouncing al Worldly plea|ſures,
and carnall delightes, lyued a Bat|cheler,
forbearing all Womens company,
and amorous allurements: and only vow|ed
himſelfe to the ſeruice of chaſte DIA|NA,
purſuing the Gentlemanly paſtime
of hunting. In the abſence of THESEVS his Father, it
chaunced that his Stepmother PHAEDRA ardently ena|mored
with his beawty and luſty age, enueigled him by all
meanes ſhee coulde, to commit wyth her filthy, and mon|ſtruous
adultry. Whych her beaſtly, vnchaſte, and vndu|tifull
practiſe, hee dutifully loathinge, ſhee turned hir for|mer
loue into extreame hatred, and told her huſband THE|SEVS
at his returne home, that his Sonne HIPPOLY|TVS
woulde haue vnlawfully layne with her. THESE|VS
belieuing his Wyues moſt vntrue accuſation, meant to
<pb facs="60"/>
haue put his ſonne to death. HIPPOLYTVS vnderſtā|ding
thereof, got vp into his Chariot and fled. THESEVS
being therewith tickeled, and after ſome purſuite, not ouer|taking
him, went to his Father AEGAEVS beeing a God of
the Sea, deſiring him to graunt him three Wiſhes: the laſt
whereof was, the deſtruction and Death of HIPPOLY|TVS:
wherevpon AEGAEVS ſent out certaine great Sea-monſters,
or Whirlepooles, which affrighting the Horſes in
HIPPOLYTVS Charyot, made them to ouerturne the
Charyot, and to runne through thick and thinne till they had
diſmēbred true HIPPOLYTVS in pieces. The remorſe
of which villany ſo ſtrake PHAEDRA in Conſcience, that
with a Sword ſhee ſtabbed herſelfe into the Entrailes, &amp; died
vpon the body of HIPPOLYTVS.</p>
