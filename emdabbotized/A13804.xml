I can deuise, were it not that I pitty the poore multitude of
Printers, these Sonnet-mungers should starue for conceits, for
all <hi>Phantastes.</hi> But these puling Louers, I cannot but laugh at
<pb facs="15"/>
them and their Encomions of their Mistresses. They make for|sooth
her hayre of Gold, her eyes of Diamond, her cheekes of
Roses, her lippes of Rubies, her teeth of Pearle, and her whole
body of Iuory: and when they haue thus Idold' her like <hi>Pig|malion,</hi>
they f●ll downe and worship her. <hi>Psyche,</hi> thou hast laid
a hard taske vpon my shoulders, to inuent at ●uery ones aske,
