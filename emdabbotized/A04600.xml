            <head>The Argument.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>DIvine Poesie</hi> (the Secretary of Nature) is
sent by Fate to <hi>Indamora,</hi> Queene of <hi>Nar|singa,</hi>
to signifie the time prefix'd was come,
when by the influence of her beauty (attended with
those lesser lights, her Contributary Ladies) the Tem|ple
of Chast Love should be re-established in this Island;
which Temple being long sought for by certaine Ma|gicians
(enemies to chast Love) intending to use it to
their intemperate ends, was by <hi>Divine Poesie</hi> hid|den
in mists and clouds; so as the Magicians being
frustrate of their hopes, sought by enchantments to
hinder all others from finding it; and by this impo|sture
many Nohle Knights and Ladies had been temp|ted
and mis-led. The fame of this Temple of Loue be|ing
quickly spread over all the Easterne world, enfla|med
a company of noble Persian youths, borderers on
India to travell in quest of it; who arriving, were by
the illusions of the Magicians, and their spirits of se|verall
Regions, almost seduced, as others had beene:
But <hi>Divine Poesie</hi> appearing, discover'd unto them
some part of the Temple unshadow'd, and prophecied
<pb facs="3"/>
of the time when <hi>Indamora</hi> and her traine should
arrive to effect this miracle; which though it seemes
somewhat hard Doctrine to most young men, yet these
being spirits of the highest ranke, forsaking the false
Magicians and their allurements, were resolved to
entertaine themselves to contemplate on this Appari|sion
untill the comming of the glorious Indian Queen.
At whose sight they being inspir'd with chast flames
might be permitted by their faithfull observance and
legitimate affections to enter and enjoy the privileges
of that sacred Temple. Then <hi>Divine Poesie</hi> sends
<hi>Orpheus</hi> her chiefe Priest in a Barque (assisted by
the Brachman● and Priests of the Temple, who meet
him on the shores) to calme the Seas with his Harpe,
that a maritime Chariot prepared by the Indian Sea-gods,
might safer, and more swiftly convay them to
atchieve this Noble ●dventure; after whose landing
having paid their Ceremonies by moving in harmo|nicall
and numerous figures, <hi>Sunesis</hi> and <hi>Thelema</hi>
(which intimate the understanding and the will) joy|ning
together, the true Temple appeares, and Chast
Love descends to invoke the last and living Heroe
(<hi>Indamora's</hi> royall Lover) that hee may helpe and
witnesse the Consecration of it.</p>

            <head>THE TEMPLE
OF LOVE.</head>
            <p>AT the lower end of the Banquetting-house, op|posite
to the State, was a Stage of six foot high,
and on that was raised an Ornament of a new
Invention agreeable to the Subject; consisting of Indian
Trophees: on the one side upon a basement sate a na|ked
Indian on a whitish Elephant, his legges shortning
towards the necke of the beast, his tire and bases of se|verall
coloured feathers, representing the Indian Mo|narchy:
On the other side an Asiatique in the habit of
an Indian borderer, riding on a Camell; his Turbant and
Coat differing from that of the Turkes, figured for the
Asian Monarchy: over these hung sheild like Compar|timents:
In that over the Indian was painted a Sunne
rising, and in the other an halfe Moone; these had for
finishing the Capitall of a great pillaster, which served
as a ground to sticke them of, and bore up a large freeze
or border with a Coronice. In this over the Indian
lay the figure of an old man, with a long white haire
and beard, representing the flood <hi>Tigris;</hi> on his head a
wreath of Canes and Seage, and leaning upon a great
Vrne, out of which runne water, by him in an extrava|gant
posture stood a Tyger.</p>
            <p>At the other end of this freeze lay another naked
man, representing <hi>Meander,</hi> the famous River of Asia,
who likewise had a great silver urne, and by him lay an
Vnicorne.</p>
            <p>In the midst of this border was fixed a rich Comparti|ment,
<pb facs="4"/>
behind which was a crimson Drapery part of it
borne up by naked Children tack'd up in severall pleats,
and the rest was at each end of the Freeze tyed with a
great knot, and from thence hung downe in foulds to
the bottome of the pedestalls: In the midst of this
Compartiment in an Ovall was written <hi>TEMPLVM||AMORIS:</hi>
all these figures were in their naturall co|lours
bigger than the life, and the Compartiments of
Gold.</p>
            <p>A Curtaine flying up the first Sceane was discover'd,
in which appeared a spacious grove of shady trees; and
a farre off on a mount with a winding way to the top
was seated a pleasant bower environed with young
trees, and in the lower part walkes planted with Cy|presse,
representing the place where the Soules of the
Ancient Poets are fained to reside: the delight of this
prospect was quickly diverted to the fight of a more
strange apparision; for, out of the heaven by little and
little broke foorth a great Cloud of a Rosie Colour,
which being come downe some little way beganne to
open, and in it was seene sitting a beautifull woman; her
garment was Sky-colour set all with Starres of gold,
her head was crowned with Laurell, with a spangled
vaile hanging downe behind, and her haire in artificiall
curles graciously dress'd, representing <hi>Divine Poesie,</hi> and
by her a milke white Swanne, as she descends singing
out of those venerable shades came forth a company of
ancient Greeke Poets, as <hi>Demodicus, Foemius, Homer, He|siod,
Terpander,</hi> and <hi>Sapho</hi> a Poetesse in habits varied and
of severall colours, with laurell wreaths on their heads.
<hi>Divine Poesie</hi> sung this:</p>

            <p>Whilst this Song continued, there came softly downe
from the highest part of the heaven a bright and trans|parent
Cloud, which being come to the middle part of
the Ayre it opened, and out of it came <hi>Amianteros,</hi> or
Chast Love flying downe, clad all in Carnation and
White, and two garlands of Laurell in one hand, and
crown'd with another of the same; whilst he descended
the Cloud closeth againe and returnes upwards, and is
hidden in the heavens; Chast Love being come downe
to the earth, was accompanied by <hi>Sunesis</hi> and <hi>Thelema,
Divine Poesie, Orpheus,</hi> and the rest of the Poets up to the
State, the great <hi>Chorus</hi> following at a distance, where
they sung this Song.</p>
