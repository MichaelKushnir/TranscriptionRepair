                  <p>COmposi●ions of this nature, have here|tofore
been graced by the acceptance,
and protection of the greatest Nobility
(I may say Princes) but in this age, when
the Scene of Drammatick Poetry is changed
into a wilderness, it is hard to find a pa|tron
to a legitimate muse. Many that were wont to
encourage Poems, are faln beneath the poverbiall
want of the composers, and by their ruins are only at
leasure ●o take measure with their eye, of what they
have been. Some extinguished with their fortune,
have this happiness, to be out of capacity of further
shipwrack, while their sad remaynes peep out of
the sea, and may serve naked marks, and caution
to other Navigators, Malignant stars the while!
In this unequall condition of the time, give me
leave to congratulate my own felicity, that hath di|rected
this Comedy unto you, who wear your no|bleness
with more security, than titles, and a name
that continues bright and impassible among the
constellations in our Sphear of <hi>English</hi> honour. I

you please to entertain these Papers, as the modest
tender of my service, I shall receive it as a most kind
influence upon me; and you will engage to all your
commands, the humble heart of</p>

                  <l>Of catching cold dares not salute this Ayr.</l>
                  <l>But ther's another reason, I hear say</l>

                  <l>The Town will still be <hi>flecking,</hi> and a Play</l>
                  <l>Though ne'r so new, will starve the second day:</l>
