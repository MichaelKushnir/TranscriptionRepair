                  <p>_CVrteous Reader, my Plaies have not beene exposed to the publike view of the world in numerous sheets, and a large volume; but singly (as thou seest) with great modesty, and small noise. These Comedies, bear|ing the title of, <hi>The fair Maid of the West:</hi> if they prove but as gratious in thy private reading, as they were plausible in the pub|lick acting, I shall not much doubt of their successe. Nor neede they (I hope) much fear a rugged and censorious brow from thee, on whom the greatest and best in the kingdome, have vouc●safed to smile. I hold it no neces|sity to trouble thee with the Argument of the story, the matter it self lying so plainly before thee in Acts and Scenes, without any deviations, or winding indents.</p>
