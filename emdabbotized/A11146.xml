said, euerie man washt his face in holy water, the
peopel crossing and blessing themselues to send them a

at <hi>Mile-ende,</hi> but the plaine truth is, the Stewes from whence
<hi>I</hi> had my quartaridgeas now growne too ●ote for me: theres
some suspection of a murther lately done vpon two Mar|chants
of the <hi>Stilliard,</hi> which indeede as farre as some fiue or
sixe stabs comes too, I confesse <hi>I</hi> had a hand in. But mum|budget,
all the Dogges in the towne must not barke at it.

               <l>How thinkes your Grace, is there a place of Pur|gatorie or no?</l>
               <l>P. Truly I think none, yet must I vrge to you whats layd</l>
               <l>To me, this world you know hath ben fiue Thousand yeres</l>
               <l>Still encreasing, still decreasing, still repleni●h't,</l>

               <l>We al do cal our selus Gods children, yet sure some are not,</l>
               <l>But think ye Tutor that the compasle of that heauen &amp; hell,</l>

               <l>That euer breathed since the first breath was giuen,</l>

               <l>Who puts these doubts within your Graceshead</l>
               <l>Are like their owne beleefe, slite, and vnregarded,</l>
               <l>And is as easily answered and confuted:</l>
               <l>Quod est inf●●itum, non habet finem,</l>
               <l>Calum est opus Dei, opus Dei est infinitum:</l>

               <l>That which is infinite hath no end at all,</l>
               <l>For that eterniti●, that euerlasting essence,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="28"/>
That did concord heauen, earth, and hell to be</l>
               <l>Is of himselfe all infinite, that heauen and hell are so,</l>
               <l>His power, his workes, and wordes doe witnesse it,</l>
               <l>For what is infinite, hath in it selle no-end,</l>
               <l>Then must the heauens which is his glorious seat,</l>
               <l>Be incomprehensible contayning him,</l>
               <l>Then what should neede a third place to containe,</l>
