                     <p>Why the mind can take no delight without the body; for the body gives the mind a being and habitation: for there would be no mind if there were no body, but if there could be a mind without a body, yet the mind could receive no delight without the pleasure of the body, for the pleasure of the body is the delight of the mind, and not the delight of the mind the pleasure of the body, for the mind doth never give nor return; wherefore come away, and leave your Solitary musing to those whose con|dition of fortune denies them the use of the World, and worldly pleasures, and do not deny your self, for I hate a self-denying Creature.</p>

                     <p>Have you seen Monsieur <hi>Thesis</hi> Book of Poems that is newly come forth?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>2 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Yes.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>1 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>And how do you approve of them?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>2 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>As well as I do of an Anagram.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>1 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>There is never an Anagram in the Book.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>2 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Why the whole Book is an Anagram of Doctor <hi>Costives</hi> Poems: for he hath only new placed the words, as they do Anagrams of names, but the whole matter, sense, and conceits is the same.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>1 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Indeed he hath imitated him.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>2 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>By your favour, imitation is only to be like another, and not the same; but his is the very same, as I have told you, for which he deserves less praises than a Imitator, although those that do imitate any Excellent Poet, do not gain so much honour to themselves, as they give honour to those they imitate; as for example, the Imitators of <hi>Homer</hi> give more honour to <hi>Homer</hi> than to themselves; for Imitators are only as Painters, where he that is imita|ted is as Nature, or the Gods, for the one draws but Copies, the other makes the Original; so that there is as much difference as a Man, and the Picture of a man.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>1 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>But a Painter that draws the Picture of a man, very like the life, he may be more famous than the man that is drawn.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>2 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>But not worshiped and adored, as Nature is, that made him: for Art cannot out-do Nature, nor do as Nature hath doue, and doth do; and an Imitator is but an Artificer, when as the Original Author is a Creator, and ought to be accounted of, and respected, and worship'd as Divine; but there are or have been but very few Poets that have such powers and parts to make a perfect Creature, which is a perfect work, as Poems, scenes, or story; but some Poets are like Chymist, that strive and labour to make as Na|ture makes, but most fail in their work, and lose their labours, wanting that Natural heat, or well-tempered matter, which should produce such Crea|tures as Nature makes, yet some 'tis said have made gold, as <hi>Raimond Lully.</hi>
                     </p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>Then <hi>Homer</hi> is a <hi>Raimond Lully</hi> in Poetry.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>2 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Nay rather <hi>Raimond Lully</hi> is a <hi>Homer</hi> in Chymistry: for no man ought to compare <hi>Homer</hi> to any Creature, by reason he hath out-wrought Nature, having done that which she never did; for Nature never made Gods, Devils, Hells, and Heavens, as <hi>Homer</hi> hath done.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>1 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>For my part I had rather be <hi>Raimond Lully</hi> than <hi>Homer:</hi> for I had rather have the Art to make Gold, than the Nature to make Poems.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>2 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>You would not gain so much by Gold as Wit.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>1 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>VVhy, what shall I gain?</p>

                  <sp>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>But Gold will bribe Fame to speak as I would have her, if I have ●old enough to bribe her.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>

                     <p>But Poems will force Fame to speak for you without a bribe.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>1 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>That were all one to me, so she speaks well, whether she be for|●●d, flattered, or bribed.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>But there is a fate of Poverty on Chymists, as much as on Poets, so that if you were as Excellent a Chymist as <hi>Raimond Lully,</hi> you would be as poor as Divine <hi>Homer.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>1 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Not if I could make Gold.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>2 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Yes, for Chymists spend more in the making of Gold, than they gain by it when it is made; and how should they do otherways, when they must needs spend a pound or pounds to make a grain? for the limbeck of a Chymist is but a little Still set a-work by a wasting fire, whereas Natures limbeck is the Earth, set a-work by an undecaiable fire, which is the Sun; this Chymist becomes as poor by an over-greedy Covetousness, as Poets by a despising Carelessness.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>1 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Then Chymists are like those Bodyes which become lean with over-eating, and Poets like those Bodyes that becomes lean by over-fasting; the one surfits, the other famishes.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>2 <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Indeed Chymists are so greedily Covetous, and feed so much on hopes, as they never leave untill such time as they have vomitted out all their wealth, and then they become sick and lean with Poverty.</p>

                     <speaker>Solitary.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, Fancies are minzed Objects, pounded and chopt by Ima|gination, which Imaginations are the several Cooks which serve the Mind, and as skillfull Cooks of several meats make Bisks or Olioes, so doth the Imagination of several Objects; and as skillfull Cooks will mix several meats, so as not any one particular shall be tasted, so doth the Imagination of several Objects or Subjects.</p>

                     <speaker>Examination.</speaker>
                     <p>But some say Fancies are Created by Motion in the Brain, which would be there were there no such materials as Objects or Subjects, which the Senses as Caterers bring in.</p>

                     <speaker>Solitary.</speaker>
                     <p>The Brain can no more Create Fancy without the materials of outward Objects, and Subjects, than Nature can Create a World without matter to make it withall; so the Brain can no more Create Fancy without the help of the Senses, than Nature can Create a Creator without the help of Motion; for though Fancies are the works of the Brain, yet the Brain could not work unless it had something to work on; but Objects and Sub|jects of Objects, may be divided in the Brain so small, or beaten so thin, as the first form may be beaten out, and when the first form is gone, we deny the matter, like as if we should deny that Paper is made with Rags, because the form of Rags is beaten out; thus by the subtill and curious motion of proud Conception joyned with the dazled memory, we deny the Senses a share, as not being Partners therein, or laboures thereof, the same way we conceive the Gods, for the Conceptions of the Gods is but minzed Ima|ginations.</p>

                     <p>Her wit is wise, and distinguishing well: for all Comtemplative persons judge, weigh, and measure out the right and truth of every thing, and find out the easiest and profitablest wayes, by the help of consideration; yet Contemplative persons when they come into Company, or publick So|cieties, their tongues do as Boys, that having been kept hard to their studies, when once they get a play day, they run wildly about, and many times do extravagant actions: so Contemplative persons when they are in Company their tongues speak extravagant words, and their behaviour for the most part is unnatural to their dispositions; but of all wits the Contempla|tive wit is the best, by reason it is a neer Neighbour to Poetry.</p>

                     <p>I desire none: for real Lovers do oftentimes prove unconstant,
<pb n="570" facs="299"/>
whereas feigned lovers are as constant as the Contemplator would have them, and as many as they would have; besides, a crowd or multitude of thoughts may rise up in the brain, and be as Spectators of one single thought, which if the Contemplator pleases may be a Lover, and the rest of the Spectators thoughts may censure of that single thought, as of his good parts, or bad, his virtues, or vices, some may praise, others dispraise, and the like; thus a Contemplator can never want Lovers, Admirers, Censurers, nor any other Company, since the Mind can present them with what thoughts they desire, not only the thoughts of Men Women and Children, but of any other Crea|tures that Nature hath made; for why should not our Spirits or Soul delight and content us, without the real possession of outward Good, as well as the Spirits or Soul doth torment us with a real Evill? for why may not Opinion, or Fancy, as well and as much delight us, as Opinion and Fancy affright us, as they often do?</p>

                     <p>But an over-studious Mind doth waste the Body, for the Thoughts feeds as much upon the Body, as the Body upon the meat we eat, and the Body nourishes the Thoughts as much as meat nourishes the Body, and for the most part, as the Body is effected so is the Mind, for a distempe|red Body makes a distempered Mind, as a Luxurious Body makes an Amorous Mind; and a Feavour in the Body makes the mind frantick, for the heat of a Feavour is like Strong-water, it makes the Spirits drunk, the Thoughts dizie, and the Mind sick.</p>

                     <p>Indeed the Body and the Mind do most commonly agree, as in Monarchy the King and the Subjects do, the Subjects obeying the King, and the King commanding the Subjects, yet sometimes the Subjects compel the King, and sometimes the King forces the Subjects, so sometimes the Appetite compels the Reason, at other times the Reason forces the Appetite to a Mo|deration, and sometimes the Humours of the Body which are like the sence|less Commonalty, and the Passions of the Soul, which are as the Nobles, of|tentimes fall out, where sometimes the Humours of the Body usurp with an uprore the Passions of the Soul, and sometimes the Passions overcome the Humours by a wise policy; but when as the Kingdome of Man is in Peace, the Imaginations in the head send down thoughts, as metal into the heart, wherein they are melted and minted into current Coin, each thought as each peece having a several stamp, some is stamped with Hate, some Spight, others Malice; some with Jealousy, some Hope, some with Fear, some Pitty, some Love, but that of Love is of the highest vallew; but these Coins serve for Commerce and Traffick in the Body, from the Authority of the Mind or Soul, whose stamp or Image each piece bears.</p>

                     <p>I cannot say never, but yet very seldome, by reason they want that heat which makes Choler; for though the Spirits of Melan|choly persons may be as quick as those that are Cholerick, yet they are not so fiery, for there is as much difference betwixt Melancholy and Choler, as freesing and burning, the one contracts into a sad silence, the other expulses in blows, and many extravagant actions, and angry words; but those persons which are seldome angry, as all Melancholy persons are, who are of a pati|tient, peaceable Nature, yet when they are angry are very angry; to those persons that are naturally Melancholy, that are seldome seen to be merry or to laugh, yet when they are merry, their mirth is ridiculous, and they will laugh extremely, as at nothing, or at any thing; so those that are naturally Contem|plative, when they do speak, they speak beyond all sense and reason, their speech flows like as a Torrent, rough and forceable; thus we may perceive that extremes one way run into extremes another way.</p>

                     <p>No truly, for if you came out of your way to see me, if it were for affection, it is a duty to Love, if for gratitude, it 'tis a duty to Obligation, if for civility, it 'tis a duty to Honour, if for Charity, it 'tis a duty to Hea|ven, and where a duty is due, the owner receives but his own when 'tis paid; wherefore it were a vain and extravagant civility, like unto madness, to give thanks for what is justly their own.</p>

                     <p>Why the Court Ladyes in a scornfull jesting, for Courtiers love to put persons out of Countenance if they can, prayed me to sing an old Song out of a new Ballad, as knowing my voice fit for no better Songs; but I told them, that if I did sing they should pay me for my pains; for there was never a blind Beggar, or poor young Wench, that sings at a door, but had somthing given them; they told me they would give me a penny, I answe|red, that when they sung to Gentlemen or Ladyes guts, that they had a shilling at least given them, and unless they would give me twelve pence a|piece, I would not sing; so they out of a laughing sport, borrowed a Crown of the Gentlemen to give me.</p>

                     <p>How should they live if they did not so? for in my Conscience they could not have made up twelve pence amongst a douzen of them, not in money; for their Clothes though costly and rich, yet are worn upon trust; but as I said, I was to sing them a Song for my money; so I sung them an old Song, the burden of the Song, <hi>Oh women, women, monstrous women, what do you mean for to do?</hi> but because the Song was against women, they would have had me given them their money back again, I told them no I would not, for it was lawfull gain for me to keep it, since I gained it by an honest industry, and that those that made a bargain must stick to it; then they told me, that if I would sing them a good old Song, they would give me another Crown; I told them I would have the money in hand, for fear they should dislike my Song when I had sung it, or at least to seem to dislike it, to save their money; so although they were loth, yet at last they borrowed another Crown to give me, thinking it did disgrace me, in that my voyce was fit for nothing but old Ballads, for all their Admirers, and Courtly Servants, or Ser|vants for Courtship were with them; so then I sung them <hi>Doctor</hi> Faustus <hi>that gave his Soul away to the Devill</hi>; for I knew Conjurers and Devills pleased women best.</p>

                     <p>I must tell you, I have been extremely troubled how to imp|loy it, insomuch as my Mind hath never been at rest; for their hath been such arguing and disputing and contradiction amongst my Thoughts, as I did verily believe there would have been a mutiny in my head: for first I did resolve to put my ten shillings to pious uses, and then I thought to build some Alms Houses, as building one long room like a Gallery, making in it several Partitions, and the outward dores all a-like; these Houses, or rather partitioned rooms, for poor old and infirm persons, that could not work nor beg for their livelyhood, to live in; but when I had well considered, that when I had built my Alms Houses, which is as I said one long Room divided by Partitions, I should have nothing left to maintain them, and they to have only House-room, and have neither Meat, Drink, Clothes, nor Fi|ling to feed them and to keep them from the injuries of the cold, having neither Fires nor Beds, I thought the Parish wherein they were Born, would better provide for them, so that instead of praying for me, they would Curse me; besides I considered, that after I was dead, had I means to leave an al|lowance, yet when it came for the Magistrates to chuse, those that should be put in they would leave out, and chuse idle young Huswives, or foul Sluts to dwell therein, such as those Magistrates would visit sometimes, to see what they did want, so as I let that design pass; then I thought to build a Church, and much were my thoughts concerned, whether the Roof should be flat, or vaulted, or sloping; but after I had resolved how the Roof should be, and where the Belfrey and Quest-room, I was sore perplex'd in my Mind, as where or how to place the Pulpit, whether at the East or West end, or at a Corner in the Church, or at one of the sides of the Church close by the Wall, but at last I resolved it should be placed in the midst of the Church, in the very Centre, that the voice of the Minister might spread round to the Circumference, so as all the Congregation might hear him; but when I con|sidered that when my Church was bnilt there was neither Benefices, Lands, nor Tithes, nor any allowance for the Minister, and that there was none that did or will preach meerly for Gods sake, but for gains sake, as to have a maintenance thereby, or some advancement therefrom, I desisted from that design; then I thought to build a Bedlam, and be the Keeper my self, but I considered that if any of the mad folkes should get loose, they might kill me, besides they stink so horribly, and require so much cleansing, not being capa|ble of keeping themselves clean, as I resolved not to go forward with that design; then I thought to build a free School, and I to be the chief Tutoress my self, but when I remembred the confused noise the Scholars make read|ing all at once, that neither I could hear nor they understand what they read, I thought it would be to no purpose, because the Scholars would profit but little by their reading, and then I should be thought an ignorant Tutoress; at last I thought to give my ten shillings to the poor Beggars, but when I con|sidered the Alms that was given to Beggars did more harm than good,

causing them to be idle and lazy, and incouraged them to go roving and Ro|guing about, I chang'd my Mind from that Act, but finding I could not imploy my ten shilligns in any pious Act, I thought to imploy it in something to be remembred by, as for Fame, whereupon I resolved to build a Pyramide or Cross, the Pyramide to be vastly high, and the Cross to be gloriously gilt, but then searing a Rebellion, and knowing that in a Rebellion a Confused and su|perstitious rout, would certainly pull them down to the ground, and that when the Cross or Pyramide was down, I should be utterly forgottten, I de|sisted from that design; so finding as little imployment for my money to any famous act as to any pious use, I resolved to imploy it to my profit, so then I had a design to set up a Shop of small wares, but when I considered how dead Trading was, and how fast Tradesmen did break, and instead of being inriched became poorer than when first they begun, for to set up a Trade requires some stock, but when they break, they have not only lost their stock, but owe more than ever their stock was, so I went from that design; then I intended to buy me a parcell of Land with my ten shillings, but hearing there was much danger in buying of Land, for that many have morgaged their Lands to one, and sold them to another, or by an old Deed that hath layen in some old Trunck, Desk, or Box, which may be brought forth to claim the Land again, so as I must be forced to go to Law for my Land I bought, which would cost me more than my Lands, besides the infinite pains and trouble in following my Law Sute, and vext with querkes, and quilters Lawyers find to prolong the Sute, or else I must let my Land go, so lose it, finding this, I thought to put my money out to use, but then I con|sidered that first I had only a piece of Parchment for my money, besides, it is a general rule that few or none take up money at use, but those that are Banckrouts, and when they had once got my money into their hands, I should neither get Use or Principal, for should I Imprison them, I should be never the neerer to get my money, for where there is nothing to be had, sayes the old Proverb, the King must lose his right; after this I intended to build a Ship, and Traffick with it on the Seas, but then considering the Various Winds, the Tempestuous Storms, the rough Seas, the lurking Sands, the dreadfull Rocks, the gaping Flouds that might split and swallow my Ship, and be drowned my self; I was resolved not to follow that design; then I thought to buy a place at Court, but when I considered how I must cringe and creep, flatter, rail, and be factious, and at last the expences at Court would be more than the profit of my place, by which I should become a Beggar, or at least a Shark, I left off that design; but after all these considerati|ons I concluded with my self that the most profitablest way to imploy my ten shillings was to build a Bawdy house, for I was sure that as soon as ever it was built Customers would resort thereunto; besides it was the most certain gain that was, without any expences, whereas all other Trades or Professi|ons require means or stocks to begin with, whereas in these Professions or Trade the poorest may set up without borrowing or begging, for a stock to begin with; neither can alterations of times ruin it, for in all times whether Peace or Wars, and in all Nations, this Trade never fails, whereunto if you please to come Ladyes, you shall be very welcome.</p>

                     <p>Because those that are Solitary love not much Company, and being alone love not much noise, and loving no noise, love silence, and loving silence, love not to talk, so as in having of her, I shall have a Solitary, Peaceable, Quiet, Silent Wife.</p>

                     <p>Because she knows most humours and passages of every body, and their affairs, so by her I should be entertained with news from all pla|ces, as of all actions done, opinions held, words spoke, or thoughts thought.</p>
