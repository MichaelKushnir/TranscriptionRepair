                  <head>TO THE RIGHT
HONOURABLE
WILLIAM
EARL OF
STRAFFORD,
Viscount Wentworth, Baron Went|worth
of Wentworth, Woodhouse,
Newmarsh, Oversley, and Raby.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>My Lord,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>_THE <hi>Character</hi> of true <hi>No|bilitie</hi>
is sacred, and inde|leble;
that Yours is such,
needeth no Testimony, the World
<pb facs="203"/>
bearing witnesse to Your Honoura|ble
<hi>Mind,</hi> upon which all other ac|cesse
of Titles wait like a fair <hi>Train</hi>
of Attendance, not Ornaments,
Your own <hi>Virtue</hi> giving them lustre,
and enterteining them as Rewards
payd down to Your Person, and
Merit.</p>
                  <p>This Principle, gave me boldnesse
to make this approach to Your Lord|ship,
and not without some design in
my Ambition, to renew my self to
Your smile, who have enjoyed the
happinesse (many yeares since) to
kisse Your hand, and to observe with
<hi>Admiration</hi> the <hi>Beauties</hi> that shin'd
upon Your Youth, which as they
gained upon Time, so they have grown
<pb facs="203"/>
above the prejudice of Opinion, and
improv'd their Maturitie by the <hi>Ear|linesse</hi>
of their Spring.</p>
                  <p>But my humble duty (my Lord)
at this fortunate hour to attend You,
cometh not alone, it bringeth a Pre|sent,
such as my weak condition could
reach to; a <hi>Poem,</hi> one, that wear|eth
no Ribbands in the forehead; not
so much as warranted by Applause;
for it happened to receive birth, when
the Stage was interdicted, and want|ed
that publique Seal which other
Compositions enjoyed; Though it
hath been read and honour'd with the
Allowance of some men, whose Opi|nion
was as acceptable to mee, as the
<pb facs="204"/>
Vote of a smiling <hi>Theater.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this is not to prescribe to your
<hi>Honour,</hi> whom I have by this Ap|plication
made my Iudge (should
You wave the <hi>Patron</hi>) and from
whom there lyes no Appeal.</p>
                  <p>If your Honour, descending
from your higher Contemplations,
vouchsa●e to look upon these Papers,
though Your Iustice should condemn
them, it would bee their Reputa|tion
to fall by so Honourable a Sen|tence:
But if they happen to ob|tain
Your Lordships favour, that
they may live, your <hi>Name</hi> will
not onely bee a powerfull defence to
them, but a lasting Record of
<pb facs="204"/>
Honour upon the Composer, whose
heart is full of Devotions to your
Lordship, and ambitious of no greater
addition, than to be known,</p>
                  <closer>
                     <salute>My Lord,</salute>
