                           <hi>SEleucus,</hi> you know the soul of our Design lies in the speedy and silent execution of the Plot; let us not then presume in their security till we fall in our own; but go, and when they have begirt the place give us notice, that with our Charge they may at once fear and feel their danger, and by us be cloath'd in Ruine ere they know whose Livery they wear—This, if Fortune be kinde, <stage>
                              <hi>Exit</hi> Seleuc.</stage> must be; for where Justice and she strike in what corner of the Earth can Victory hide her self, and that youthful hand not finde her?</p>

                        <p>I should blush at this, if there needed more Arguments to confirm I shall be victorious than the reward propos'd; for had the Gods intended the far-fam'd <hi>Claricilla's</hi> Virtues a Reward for Treason they would not then have left her Virtue such a Guard, whose power hath stood amongst Traitors when yours fell upon the faith that bore it.</p>

                        <p>You oblige me, Sir, and this goodness makes me beg you would be pleas'd to let me once again call to your memory some particulars of that tedious story which so often in my miseries I re|counted to your Highness: This Traitor <hi>Silvander</hi> having by my love gain'd an interest, and by my smiles climb'd o're the Heads of all his Fellows in the strength of that trust grew too powerfull for me, and in a Battel (where my cause onely struck) our Forces be|ing not half the Traitors number we lost the day, to which Theft, not Conquest, was joyn'd the Murder of my Brother and loss both of my Crown and Daughter.</p>

                        <p>That fault the Gods will punish; but his usurpation of the Princess, and intended Rape which in a forc'd Marriage he la|bours, are those that blow my rage.</p>

                        <p>'Tis true, it has always been his aim, but his Love, by Hea|ven appointed for his punishment and our Guard, has given her a constant power over him, which we have so directed that she has prevail'd with him to quit his greatest strength, and retreat with her to this private <hi>Villa,</hi> where now he remains attended onely with some few Troops of Horse: This opportunity we owe her piety, that has put it in our power to strike for our Revenge and Right again.</p>

                        <p>Arm, Sir, and behold how in the obedience to your commands they are lost; Ruine in silence like Growth steals up|on them; th'are now empal'd, and destruction hovers yet undis|cover'd to the Prey; but defer not, for Night makes haste away, and the Cause hath such a Glory cast about the Souldier that it forceth Day, and Victory in their resolution waits but your Com|mand to send her forth.</p>

I know 'twill startle his soul; and if it fail to ruine him, yet 'twill take the edge o'th Kings faith off from what he says, and with jealous eyes he will look upon his growing greatness; and when he is thus shook, thus parted from the Cedar that shelters him, then let thy justice pour a storm upon his head: And now by the power <hi>Melintus</hi> hath given me I command him deliver his honour for a time into my protection; this (if I have not appear'd too careless of mine own) you cannot deny me.</p>

                        <p>Wounds are the food of Slaves, else I deserve not these for my faith; but Loyalty is against kinde in me, and therefore I am punish'd for obeying your command, which was that no man without exception, should pass this way till I had given you no|tice, which he would have done, and because I refus'd him thus my faith's rewarded.</p>

But to the business; early this morning there came to my Galley (which now rides in the haven) two strangers, as they pretended, that had unfortunately in a duel slain one that had a neer relation to your Majesty, and by many arguments pleaded my protection; which at first sight their miseries engag'd me to, and I undertook to serve them: one of them (the fair-hair'd-man) gave me a Letter to deliver to the Prin|cess, from whom he says I should have great rewards if I would be faithful; I undertook it; and if this may procure my peace, when you please to command me, they are dead.</p>

By this hand I have lain with a hundred unsound Wenches with less dan|ger than I have look'd upon this wooing, this scurvy honourable Matrimony, which is so dangerous a thing the very standers by are not safe. I must swim but for wishing well to it; but from this time either <hi>Melintus</hi> shall quit his honourable way to his Loves, or I'll leave him to the honourable dangers.</p>
