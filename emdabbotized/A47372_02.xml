                        <p>No more, I'le sooner be reconcil'd to want, or sickness, then that Rascal; A thing, that my Charity made sociable; one, that when I smil'd would fawn upon me, and wag his stearn, like starved Dogs; so nasty, the Com|pany cried foh upon him; He stunk so of <hi>Poverty, Ale,</hi> and <hi>Bawdry.</hi> So poor and despicable, when I relieved him, he could not avow his calling, for want of a Cassock, but stood at Corners of Streets, and whisper'd Gentlemen in the Ear, as they pass'd, and so deliver'd his Wants like a Message which being done, the Rogue vanished, and would dive at Westminster like a Dabchick, and rise again at Temple-gate; The ingenuity of the Rascal, his Wit being snuft by want, burnt cleer then, and furnish'd him with a bawdy Jest or two, to take the Company; But now the Rogue shall find he has lost a Patron.</p>

                        <p>As I live, if I had thought you would have been in such a fury, you should never have known it.</p>

                        <p>Treacherous Rogue, he has always rayl'd against thee to me, as a danger his Friendship ought to give me warning of; and nightly cry'd, yet look back, and hunt not, with good Nature and the beauties of thy Youth, that false Woman; But hear thy Friend, that speaks from sad Experience.</p>

                        <p>Yes, faith, and urg'd, you (for your part) were never particular, and seldom sound.</p>
                     </sp>

                        <speaker>Want.</speaker>
                        <p>Not sound? Why, he offer'd to marry me, and swore he thought I was chast, I was so particular; and prov'd it, that con|sent was full marriage, by the first Institution, and those that love, and lie together, and tell, have fulfill'd all Ceremonies now.</p>

                        <p>If I have any power I shall prevaile; thou know'st he has a fat Benefice, and leave me to plague him, till he give it me to be rid of thee.</p>

                        <p>I keep thee? prithee, wilt thou keep me? I know not why men are such Fools to pay? We bring as much to the sport, as Wo|men; Keep thee? I'de marry thee as soon; Why? <hi>that's Wedding sin;</hi> No, no keeping I, that you are not your own, is all that pre|fers you before Wives.</p>

                        <p>Marry, I would he would take exception, he should not want ill usage to rid me of his trouble; as I live, custom has made me so acquainted with him, that I now begin to think him not so displeasing, as at first; and if he fall not out with me, I must with him, to secure my self. Sure (Aunt) he must find Sence and Rea|son absent, for when a Question knocks at his head, the Answer tells that there is no body at home; I ask'd him, th'other day, if he did not find a blemish in his understanding, and he sware a great Oath, Not he; I told him 'twas very strange, for Fool was so visible an eye-sore, that neither Birth nor Fortune eould reconcile to me.</p>

                        <p>Why, pray, Aunt, take him to your self, and see how merry we will be; I can laugh at any bodies Fool, but mine own.</p>

                        <p>By my troth, but that I have married one Fool already, you should not have him. Consider, he asks no portion, and yet will make a great joynture; a Fool with these conveniences, a kind loving Fool, and one that you may govern, makes no ill hus|band; Niece, there are other Arguments too, to bid a Fool wel|come, which you will find without teaching; think of it, Niece; you may lay out your affection to purchase some dear wit, or judgement of the City, and repent, at leisure a good bargain, in this Fool.</p>

                        <p>Faith, Aunt, Fools are cheap in the Butchery, and dear in the Kitchin; they are such unsavory infipid things that there goes more charge to the sauce then the Fool is worth, ere a woman can confidently serve him, either to her bed or board; then if he be a loving Fool, he troubles all the world a days, and me all night.</p>

                        <p>Why, as I live, he's a handsome fellow, and merry; mine is such a sad soul, and tells me stories of Lovers that dy'd in de|spair, and of the lamentable end of their Mistresses (according to the Ballad) and thinks to win me by Example.</p>

                        <p>Your Nephew? not I, As I live; he looks as if he would be woo'd; I'll warrant you, he'l never begin with a woman till he has lost the opinion of himself; But since you are so courteous, I'le speak to his friend, and let him know how you suffer for him.</p>

                        <p>Him! marry God bless all good women from him; why, he talks as if the Dairy-maid and all her Cows could not serve his turn; then they wear such baudy-breeches, 'twould startle an ho|nest woman to come in their company, for fear they should break, and put her to count from the fall of them; for I'le warrant, the year of the Lord would sooner out of her head then such a sight.</p>

                        <p>I am not such an enemy now to his humour as to your Nephews, he rails against our sex, and thinks by beating down the price of women to make us despair of Merchants; But if I had his heart-strings tied on a True-lovers-knot, I would so firk him till he found physick in a Rope.</p>

                        <p>Why, he swore, he had a better opinion of her then to think she had her Maiden-head; but if she were that Fool, and had preserv'd the toy, he swore he would not take the pains of fetching it, to have it; I confess, I would fain be reveng'd on them, because they are so blown up with opinion of their wit.</p>

                        <p>Serve turn! Prithee what haste, <hi>Secret?</hi> that I should put my self to bed with one I might make a shift with; when I marry, thou shalt cry, I, marry, Madam; this is a husband without blushing wench, and none of your so-so husbands; yet he might half overcome my aversion, I confess.</p>

                        <p>Overcome! I think so, he might have won a City his way; for when he saw you were resolv'd he should not eat with you, he would set himself down as if he meant to besiege us, and had vow'd never to rise till he had taken us in; and because our sex forbad force, he meant to do it by famine; yet you may stay, and miss a better market; for hang me, I am of <hi>Secrets</hi> opinion; he had but two faults, a handsome fellow, and too soon deny'd.</p>

                        <p>'Tis true, he was a handsome fellow, and a civil, that I shall report him; for as soon as it was given him to understand; I desir'd he would come no more, I never saw him since, but by chance.</p>

                        <speaker>Wid.</speaker>
                        <p>There were divers exceptions; But that which angred me then, was, he came with the Kings Letters Patents, as if he had been to take up a wife for his Majesties use.</p>

those merry days, a Bailiff trode the streets with terror, when all the Chains in the City were rusty, but Mr. Sheriffs, when the people knew no evil but the Constable and his Watch; Now every Committee has as much power, and as little manners, and examines with as much ignorance, impertinence and authority, as a Constable in the Kings key.</p>

                        <p>Yes, but I think thou hast more wit then to fight with me; for if I kill thee, 'tis a fortune to me, and others will sign in fear; and if thou should'st kill me, any body that knows us would swear 'twere very strange, and cry, there's Gods just judgement now upon that lewd youth, and thou procur'st his hang-mans place at the rate of thy Estate.</p>

I must have some trick to break his neck, else the young Rogue will work me out; 'tis an excellent old Lady, but I dare not call her so; yet would she were young enough to bear, we might do some good for our heirs, by leaving such a charitable brood behind; she's a woman after the first kind; 'tis but going in to her and you may know her; then she'l oblige so readily, and gives with greater thankes then others receive, takes it so kindly to be courted. I am now to ob|lige her (as she calls it) by professing young <hi>Wilds</hi> love, and de|siring an assurance; she's sensible of his sufferings, which though it be false, and beyond my Commission, yet the hopes of such a new young thing that has the vogue of the Town, for handsomest, 'twill so tickle her age, and so blow up her vanity, to have it said, He is in love with her, and so endear her to me for being the means that the Parsons malice will be able to take no root;—She comes, I must not be seen.—</p>

                        <p>Faith, Madam, if it had been my own business I should not have ventur'd so boldly; But the necessity that forces me to come concerns my friend, against whom if your mercy be now bounded with those strict ties of honour, and cold thoughts which I have ever found guard your heart, My friend, a young and handsome man, is lost, is lost in his prime, and falls like early blos|soms; But methinks you should not prove the envious frost to de|stroy this young man, this delicate young man, that has whole bun|dles of Boys in his Breeches; yet if you be cruel, he and they dye, as useless as open Arses gathered green. <stage>She must be earnest in her looks all the time he speaks; des|rous to know who he speaks of.</stage>

                        <p>Good Captain, out with the particular, what way can my charity assist him; you know by experience I cannot be cruel, remember how I fetch'd you out of a swoond, and laid you in my own bed.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Capt.</speaker>
                        <p>That act preserved a life, that has always been labour'd in your service; and I dare say, your charity here will find as fruitful a gratitude.</p>

Take wise Men from Cuckolds, and fools to make them; for your wise Man draws eyes and suspition with his visit, and begets jealous thoughts in the Husband, that his Wife may be overcome with his parts; when the fool is welcome to both, pleaseth both, laughes with the one, and lies with the other, and all without suspition; I tell thee, a fool that has money is the Man. The wits and the we's, which is a distinct Parreal of Wit bound by it self, and to be sold at <hi>Wit-hall,</hi> or at the sign of the Kings-head in the Butchery; these wise things will make twenty jealous, ere one Man a Cuckold; when the fa|mily of fools will head a Parish ere they are suspected.</p>

                        <p>When your constant Lover, if a Woman have a mind to him, and be blest with so much grace to discover it; He, out of the noble mistake of Honour hates her for it, and tells it per|chance, and preaches Reason to her Passion, and cryes, miserable Beauty, to be so unfortunate as to inhabit in so much frailty.</p>

                        <p>This counsel makes her hate him more then she lov'd before; These are troubles, those that love are subject to, while we look on and laugh, to see both thus slav'd while we are free.</p>

                        <p>I would he would; for as 'tis, there's no hopes amongst the Ladies; besides, 'tis such an example to see a King and Queen good, Husband and Wife, that to be kind will grow out of fashion.</p>

                        <p>Nay, that's not all, for the women grow malicious, be|cause they are not courted; nay, they bred all the last mischiefs, and call'd the Kings chastity a neglect of them.</p>

                        <p>Thou art in the right; An <hi>Edward,</hi> or a <hi>Harry,</hi> with <hi>seven Queens in Buckram,</hi> that <hi>Haught</hi> among the men, and <hi>Stroakt</hi> the wo|men, are the Monarchs they wish to bow to; they love no tame Princes, but Lyons in the Forest.</p>

                        <p>Why, and those were properly call'd the Fathers of their People, that were indeed akine to their Nobility; now they wear out their youth and beauty, without hope of a monumental Bal|lad, or Trophee of a Lie-bell that shall hereafter point at such a Lord, and cry that is the royal Son of such a one.</p>

                        <p>And these were the ways that made them powerful at home; for the City is a kind of tame Beast; you may lead her by the horns any whither, if you but tickle them in the ear sometimes. Queen <hi>Bess,</hi> of famous memory, had the trick on't; and I have heard them say, <hi>In Eighty eighty,</hi> er'e I was born, as well I can re|member, she rode to <hi>Tilbury</hi> on that bonny Beast, the Mayor.</p>

as much to say, I belong to such a Lord; the next with B for an elder Brother; C for such a Knight; D possest with melancholy, and at her breast you may knock an hour er'e you get an answer, and then she'l tell you there's no lodging there; she has a constant fellow Courtier that has taken up all her heart to his own use: in short, All are dispos'd of, but the good Mother; and she comes in like the Sabbath, at the weeks end; and I warrant her make any one rest that comes at her.</p>

                        <p>And what think you, is not this finely carryed? you that are about the King, counsel him, if he will have his sport fair, he must let the Game be free, as it has been in former Ages; then a stranger that has wit, good means, and handsome cloaths, no sooner enters the privy Chamber, and beat about with three graceful legs, but he spring a Mistress that danc'd as well as he, Sung better, as free as fair; those at first sight could speak, for wit is always acquainted: These fools must be akin er'e they can speak; and now the friends make the bargain, and they go to Bed er'e they know why.</p>

                        <p>Faith, Madam, it is our care of them; why you see they are married at fourteen, yield a Crop and a half, and then dye, 'tis meerly their love that destroys'em; for if they get a good hus|bandman, the poor things yield their very hearts.</p>

                        <p>We will petition the lower House, there are young men, and (if it were but to be factious) would pass it, if they thought

the upper house would Cross it; Besides, they ought to do it, Death! they provide against cutting down old Trees, and pre|serving high-ways and Post-horses, and let pretty Wenches run to decay?</p>

As I live, the State ought to take care of those Pretty creatures; Be you Judge, Madam; Is't not a sad sight to see a rich young Beauty, with all her Innocence and Blossoms on, subject to some rough rude Fellow, that ploughs her; and esteems and uses her as a chattel, till she is so lean, a man may finde as good Grass upon the Common, where it may be shee'le sit coughing with sunk Eyes, so weak that a Boy (with a Dog) that can but whistle, may keep a score of them?</p>

                        <p>I know not what they are; but for my part, I'le be a Tray|tor ere I'le look on, and see Beauty go thus to wrack; it is enough, custom has made us suffer them to be enclos'd; I am sure, they were created common, and for the use of Man, and not intended to be subject to jealousie and choler, or to be bought or sold, or let for term of lives or years, as they are now, or else sold at Out-crys; Oh!

                        <p>No, not all; I have heard of <hi>Whittington</hi> and his Cat, and o|thers, that have made Fortunes by strange means; But I scarce believe my Son would rise from Hope, a half peny, and a Lambs|skin; And the Wenches commonly having more Wit &amp; Beauty then Money, foreseeing small Portions, grow sad, and read Romances, till their Wit spie some unfortunate merit like their own, without money too, and they two sigh after one another, till they grow my|sterious in Colours, and become a Proverb for their constancy; and when their Love has worn out the cause, marry in the end a new Couple, then grown asham'd of the knowledge they so long hunted, at length part, by consent, and vanish into <hi>Abigail</hi> and Governour.</p>

I believe 'tis the first time you have found them lie at the sign of the Page, Foot-men and gilded Coaches; They were wont to lodge at the thin Cloak, they and their Muses made up the Family; And thence sent Scenes to their Patrons, like Boyes in at windowes, and one would return with a Dublett, another with a pair of Breeches, a third with a little ready Money; which, to|gether with their credit with a company, in three Tearms you rare|ly saw a Poet repaired.</p>

                        <p>Have not you heard of the Scriveners Wife that brought the Black-moore from the holy Land, and made him a Brownist; and in pure charity lay with him, and was deliver'd of a Mag-Pie; a pied Prophet; which when the elect saw, they prophesi'd, if it liv'd, 'twould prove a great enemy to their Sect; for the Mid-wife cri'd out, 'twas born a Bishop, with Tippet and white-sleeves; at which the zealous Mother cri'd, Down with the Idoll; so the Mid-wife and she in pure devotion kill'd it.</p>

                        <speaker>Joll.</speaker>
                        <p>Why, they were taken and condemn'd, and suffer'd under a Catholick Sheriff, that afflicted them with the Letany all the way from <hi>New-gate</hi> to the Gallows, which in Rog'ry he made to be set up Altar-wise too, and hang'd them without a Psalm.</p>

                        <p>I know not, <hi>Gregory</hi> turn'd them off, and so they de|scended, and became Brown-martyrs.</p>

                        <p>Faith, 'tis a truth, this I shall say, you may all better your pleasures by, if you will observe it; I dare say, the fear of telling keeps more women honest then <hi>Bridewell</hi> Hemp; And were you wise men, and true Lovers of liberty, now were the time to bring wenching to that perfection no age could ever have hoped; now you may sow such seed of pleasure, you may be prayed for here|after; Now, in this Age of zeal and Ignorance, would I have you four, in old cloathes, and demure looks, present a Petition to both Houses, and say, you are men touched in Conscience for your share in that wicked ness which is known to their worships by the plea|sure of Adultery, and desire it may be death, and that a Law may be pass'd to that purpose; How the women will pray for you, and at their own charges rear Statu's in memory of their Benefactors; the young and kind would then haunt your Chambers, Pray, and present you, and Court the Sanguine youth, for the sweet sin se|cur'd by such a Law; None would lose an Occasion, nor chur|lishly oppose kind Nature, nor refuse to listen to her summons, when youth and Passion calls for those forbidden sweets; when such security as your lives are at stake, who would fear to trust; with this Law all Oaths and Protestations are cancell'd; Letters and Bawdes would grow useless too; By instinct the Kind will find the Kind; and having one nature become of one mind; Now we lose an Age, to observe and know a mans humour, ere we dare trust him; But get this Law, then 'tis, like and enjoy; and whereas now, with expence of time and Fortune, you may glean some one Mistriss amongst your neighbours wives, you shall reap women whole Armfulls as in the Common field; there is one small Town, wise onely in this Law; and I have heard them say, that know it well, There has been but one Execution this hundred years; yet the same party searched seven years, and could not find an honest wo|man in the Town.</p>

                        <p>As I live, the accident troubles me; and I am sorry such a misfortune should beget me this favour; and I could wish my self free from the honour, if the cause were removed too.</p>

                        <p>Indeed 'tis time she sat out, and gave others leave to play; for a Reveren'd whore is an unseemly sight; besides it makes the sin malicious, which is but venial else.</p>

All things for nothing; then they are the diligent'st and the humblest things a Woman can employ; Nay, I ha' seen of them tame, and run loose about a house; I had one once, by this light, he would fetch and Carry, go back, seek out, he would do any thing; I think some Faulconer bred him.</p>

                        <p>Faith, when I married he forsook me; I was advis'd since, that if I would ha'spit in's mouth sometimes he would have stay'd.</p>

You see, your Aunt's provided of a man. Bless him, and send him patience, 'twould have been fine to have seen me walking, and sigh|ing upon cold hunting, seeking my whore again, or forc'd to make use of some common mercenary thing that sells sin and diseases, crimes, penance and sad repentance together; here's consolation and satisfaction, in <hi>Wanton,</hi> though a man lose his meal with the widow. And, faith, be free, how do you like my Girle; rid thee of her; what do's she want now, pray, but a joynture, to satisfie any honest man? speak your conscience; Ladies don't you think a little repentance, hereafter, will serve, for all the small sins that good nature can act with such a sinner?</p>

                        <p>Madam, I find you have discover'd our design, whose chief end was, to prevent this mischief which I doubt not, but you'le both live to repent your share of, before you have done tra|velling to the Epsams, Burbons, and the Spawes, to cure those tra|vell'd diseases these Knights errant have, with Curiosity, sought out for you; 'Tis true, th' are mischiefs that dwell in pleasant Countries, yet those Roses have their thorns; and I doubt not, but these gentlemens wit may sting as well as please, sometime; and you may find it harder to satisfie their travail'd Experience, then to have suffer'd our home-bred ignorance.</p>

                        <p>Faith, Sir, you see what a difficulty it is, in this Age, for a woman to live honest, though she have a proper man to her hus|band; therefore it behoves us to consider, who we choose.</p>

                        <p>The Lady has Reason; for being allow'd but one, who would choose such weazel's as we see daily mary'd, that are all head and Tail, crooked, dirty, sold Vermin, predestin'd for Cuckolds, painted Snails, with houses on their backs, and horns as big as <hi>Dutch</hi> Cows; would any woman marry such? nay, can any wo|man be honest, that lets such Hod-man-dods crawle o're her Virgin breast, and Belly, or suffer 'em to leave their slimy paths upon their bodies onely for Joyntures? Out, 'tis Mercenary and base; The generous heart has onely the Laws of Nature and kindness in her view; and when she will oblige, Friend is all the ties that nature seeks, who can both bear and excuse those kind crimes; And I be|lieve, one as poor as the despis'd <hi>Captain,</hi> and neglected Courtier, may make a woman as happy in a Friendship as Master <hi>Sadd,</hi> who has as many faults as we have debts; one, whose Father had no more credit with Nature, then ours had with Fortune; whose soul wears Rags as well as the <hi>Captains</hi> body.</p>

                        <p>Faith, Master <hi>Sadd,</hi> hee's parlously in the right; ne're think of marrying in this dull clime, wedlock's a trade you'le ne're go through with; wives draw-bills upon sight, and't will not be for your credit to protest 'em; rather follow my counsel, and Marry <hi>la Venetiano</hi> for a night and away; a Pistol Joynture do's it; then 'tis but repenting in the morning, and leave your woman, and the sin both, i'th Bed; But if you play the fool, like your friends, and Marry in serious earnest, you may repent it too, as they do; but wher's the remedy?</p>

I'me sure he has the worst tongue; and a conscience that neither honour nor truth binds; and therefore 'tis to be belie|ved, if he will rail in publick he may be even with your Poet; I will cloath and feed him and his Muse this seven years, but I will plague him: <hi>Secret</hi> tells me, 'twas your Poet too that pawn'd me, to day, in the Tavern.</p>
