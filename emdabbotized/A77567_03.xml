                           <p>Phew; that will follow. What new Planta|tion was ever peopled with the better ſort at firſt; nay, commonly, the lewdeſt blades, and naughty|packs are either neceſſitated to 'hem, or elſe do prove the moſt forward venturers. Is not lime and hair the firſt in all your foundations? do we not ſoile or dung our lands, before we ſowe or plant any thing that's good in 'hem? And do not weeds creep up firſt in all Gardens? and why not then in this? which never was a Garden until now; and which will be the Gar|den of Gardens, I foreſee't. And for the weeds in it, let me alone for the weeding of them out. And ſo as my Reverend Anceſtor <hi>Juſtice Adam Overdoe,</hi> was wont to ſay, <hi>In Heavens name and the Kings,</hi> and for the good of the Common-wealth I will go a|bout it.</p>

He was to lie at <hi>Hammerſmith</hi> laſt night, and requeſted an early meeting of me this morning here, to aſſiſt him in the taking of a houſe. It is my buſineſſe hither; for he could never do't himſelfe. He has the oldeſt touchy, wrangling humour.—But in a harmleſſe way; for he hurts no body, and pleaſes himſelf in it. His children have all the trouble of it, that do anger him in obeying him ſometimes. You will know him anon. I mean, he ſhall be your Tenant. And luckily he comes.</p>

though preſently he findes 'em moſt commodious to him; things that he knows not how to be without, and oftentimes deſires with the ſame breath the things he viliſied, and ſcorn'd them the laſt ſyllable he ſpake before.

                           <p>There Sir, I'le undertake one good fellow, that has but juſt as much Religion as will ſerve an honeſt mans turne, will bear more wine then ten of theſe gid|dy-braind Puritanes, their heads are ſo full of whim|ſeys.</p>

                           <p>'Tis mighty headie, mighty headie, and truly I cannot but think that the over much abuſe of theſe out-landiſh liquors, have bred ſo many errours in the Romiſh Church.</p>

                           <p>Indeed brother, there is too much abuſe made of ſuch good creatures. Wine in it ſelf is good, you will grant, though the exceſſe be nought; and Ta|vernes are not contemptible, ſo the company be good.</p>

                           <p>It had been good to have humbled him, though into the knowledge of his Tranſ●reſſion. And of himſelf for his ſoules good, either by courſe of Law, or elſe in caſe of neceſſity, where the Law promiſeth no releefe, by your own right hand you might have ſmote him, ſmote him with great force, yea, ſmote him unto the earth, until he had prayed that the evil might be taken from him.</p>

This fellow has in ſtead of braines, a Cob-web in his Noddle, with little ſtrawes, feathers, and wings of dead Butterflies hanging in it, that having motion by his aery fancie, there dance and keep a Racket; 'tis to teach women ſilence, or ſome ſuch fooliſh impoſſibility.

I, the divel was in't, and now he vexes me again; we agreed in one point ſo well, that we have undone a couple of our children by it, and hindred the getting of <hi>I</hi> know not how many more. His ſon and my daughter ſhould have married. And on a ſndden he and I both conſented to a diſlike of the match and broke it, and have both repented it an hundred times ſince. We agree very wel in that point; and now is his ſon irrecoverably loſt, and my daughter reſolutely bent to be an Ape-leader in <hi>Limbo.</hi> But whats all this to the affliction I ſuffer in my ſons now? that one of them from a riotous boy. ſhould grow into a Puritanical Woodcock; and the tother from a civil well-qualified fellow, turn'd abſolute Ruffian.
