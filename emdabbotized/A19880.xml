            <head>The Subject of the MASQVE.</head>
            <p>_DIſcord a malicious Fury, ap|peares in a ſtorme, and by the Invocation of malignant ſpi|rits, proper to her evill uſe, having already put moſt of the world into diſorder, endea|vours to diſturbe theſe parts, envying the bleſsings and Tranquility we have long enjoyed.</p>
            <p>Theſe Incantations are expreſſed by thoſe ſpi|rits in an Antimaſque: who on a ſudden are ſur|priſed, and ſtopt in their motion by a ſecret pow|er, whoſe wiſedome they tremble at, and depart as foreknowing, that Wiſedome will change all their malicious hope of theſe diſorders into a ſud|den calme, which after their departure is prepa|red by a diſperſt Harmony of Muſique.</p>
            <p>This ſecret Wiſdome in the Perſon of the King attended by his Nobles, and under the name of <hi>Philogenes</hi> or Lover of his People, hath his ap|pearance prepared by a Chorus, repreſenting the
<pb facs="3"/>
beloved people, and is inſtantly diſcovered, en|vironed with thoſe Nobles in the throne of Ho|nour.</p>
            <p>Then the Queene perſonating the chiefe He|roin, with her martiall Ladies, is ſent downe from Heaven by <hi>Pallas</hi> as a Reward of his Pru|dence, for reducing the threatning ſtorme into the following calme.</p>

            <p>IN the border that encloſed the Sceans and made a frontiſpice to all the worke, in a ſquare Neech on the right hand ſtood two figures of women, one of them expreſſing much majeſty in her aſpect, apparelled in sky colour with a crowne of gold on her head, and a bridle in her hand, repreſenting Rea|ſon: the other embracing her was in changeable ſilke with wings at her ſhoulders, figured for intelle|ctuall Appetite, who while ſhe imbraceth Reaſon, all the actions of men are rightly governed. Above theſe in a ſecond order, were winged children, one ri|ding on a furious Lion, which hee ſeemes to tame with reynes and a bit: Another bearing an Antique enſigne: the third hovering above with a branch of Palme in his hand, expreſſing the victory over the Perturbations. In a Neech on the other ſide ſtood two figures joyning hands, one a grave old man in a robe of purple, with a heart of gold in a chayne a|bout his necke, figured for Counſell; the other a woman, in a garment of cloth of gold, in her hand a ſword with a ſerpent winding about the blade, re|preſenting Reſolution, both theſe being neceſſary to the good meanes of arriving to a vertuous end.</p>
            <p>Over theſe and anſwering to the other ſide was a round Altar rayſed high, and on it the bird of Pallas, figured for Prudence: on eyther ſide were children with wings, one in act of Adoration, another hold|ing a booke, and a third flying over their heads with a lighted Torch in his hand, repreſenting the intel|lectuall light accompanied with Doctrine and Diſci|pline, and alluding to the figures below, as thoſe on the other ſide.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="4"/>Above theſe ran a large Freeſe, with a Cornice|ment: in the midſt wherof was a double Comparti|ment rich and full of ornament: on the top of this ſate Fame with ſpreaded wings, in act, ſounding a Trumpet of gold: joyning to the Compartiment in various poſtures lay two Figures in their naturall colours as big as the life; one holding an Anchor repreſenting ſafety; the other expreſſing Riches, with a Cornu-copia; and about her ſtood Antique vaſes of gold. The reſt of this Freeſe was compo|ſed of Children, with ſignificant ſignes to expreſſe their ſeverall qualities; Forgetfulneſſe of injuries, extinguiſhing a flaming torch on an Armor; Com|merce, with eares of Corne; Felicity, with a basket of Lillies; Affection to the Countrey, holding a Graſhopper; Proſperous ſucceſſe, with the Rud|der of a Ship; Innocence, with a branch of Fearne: All theſe expreſſing the ſeverall goods, followers of peace and Concord, and fore-runners of humane felicity: ſo as the worke of this Front conſiſting of Picture qualified with morall Philoſophy, temper'd delight with profit.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of the aforeſaid Compartiment in an Ovall Table was written.</p>

               <pb facs="4"/>But before I proceed in the deſcriptions of the Sceanes, it is not amiſſe briefly to ſet downe the Hi|ſtories from whence theſe Proverbs tooke their o|riginall.</p>
            <p>For the firſt <hi>Melas</hi> and <hi>Arevanias</hi> of <hi>Argos,</hi> and <hi>Troezen</hi> conducted a common Colony to <hi>Habicar|naſſus</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and there drave out the barbarous <hi>Ca|rie</hi> and <hi>Lelegi,</hi> who fled up to the Mountaines; from whence they made many incurſions, robbing and cruelly ſpoyling the Grecian Inhabitants, which could by no meanes be prevented.</p>
            <p>On the top of the right horne of the hill which ſurrounds <hi>Halicarnaſſus,</hi> in forme of a Theater, is a famous Fountaine of moſt cleare water, and exquiſite taſte called <hi>Salmacis:</hi> It happened that neere to this Fountaine one of the Colony (to make gaine by the goodneſſe of the water) ſet up a Taverne, and furniſh'd it with all neceſſaries, to which the Barbarians reſorting (entiſed by the deli|cious taſte of this water, at firſt ſome few, and after many together in troops,) of fierce and cruell na|tures, were reduced of their owne accord to the ſweetneſſe of the Grecian cuſtomes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The other <hi>Adage</hi> is thus derived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Citie of <hi>Thebes,</hi> anciently called <hi>Cadmia,</hi> had warre with <hi>Adraſtus,</hi> the Argive King, who raiſed a great Army of <hi>Arcadians</hi> and <hi>Miſſenians,</hi> and fought a battaile with them neere <hi>Iſmenia,</hi> where the <hi>The|bans</hi> were overthrowne, turned their backs, and fled into their City; the <hi>Peloponneſians</hi> (not accuſtomed to skale walled Townes) aſſaulting furiouſly, but
<pb facs="5"/>
without order, were repulſt from the walls by the defendants, and may of the <hi>Argives</hi> ſlaine: at that in|ſtant the beſieged making a great ſally, and finding the enemy in diſorder and confuſion, cut them all in pieces, onely <hi>Adraſtus</hi> excepted, who was ſaved by flight: but this victory was gotten with great da|mage and ſlaughter of the <hi>Thebans,</hi> for few of them returned alive into their City.</p>
            <p>The alluſion is, That his Majeſty out of his mercy and clemency approoving the firſt Proverbe, ſeekes by all meanes to reduce tempeſtuous and turbulent natures into a ſweet calme of Civill concord.</p>
            <p>A Curtayne flying up, a horrid Sceane appeared of ſtorme and tempeſt: no glimpſe of the Sun was ſeene, as if darkeneſſe, confuſion, and deformity, had poſſeſt the world, and driven light to Heaven, the trees bending, as forced by a guſt of winde, their branches rent from their trunkes, and ſome torne up by the roots: a farre off was a darke wrought ſea, with rowling billowes, breaking againſt the rockes, with rayne, lightning and thunder: in the midſt was a globe of the Earth, which at an inſtant falling on fire, was turned into a Fury, her hayre upright, mixt with ſnakes, her body leane wrinkled and of a ſwar|thy colour, her breaſts hung bagging downe to her waſte, to which with a knot of ſerpents was girt red baſes, and under it tawny skirts downe to her feet: in her hand ſhe brandiſht a ſable Torch, and looking a Scanſe with hollow envious eyes came downe into the Roome.</p>
