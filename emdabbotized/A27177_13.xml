                        <l>A Story, and a known one, long ſince writ,</l>
                        <l>Truth must take place, and by an able wit,</l>

                        <l>And to maintaine to all our Innocence,</l>
                        <l>Thus much, though he hath travel'd the ſame way,</l>
                        <l>Demanding, and receiving too the pay</l>
