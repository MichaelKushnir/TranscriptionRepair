            <p>IAm bold to preſent you with this Peece of the PAS|SION, the Originall deſigned by the curious Penſill of <hi>Gro|tius:</hi> whoſe former afflictions ſeeme to have taught him pli|able paſsions, and art to rule the affections of others: cloath|ing the ſaddeſt of Subjects in the ſutable attire of Tragedy; not without the Example of two ancient Fathers of the Primi|tive Church, <hi>Apollinarius</hi> and <hi>Nazianzen.</hi> The Argument is
<pb facs="3"/>
of both the Teſtaments a pathe|ticall Abſtract. Thoſe formi|dable Wonders, effected by God in his owne Common-wealth; thoſe ſtupendious Miracles, for truth a Pattern to all Hiſtory, for ſtrangeneſſe to all Fables; here meet together to attend on CHRIST'S PASSION. The ef|fects of his Power here ſweet|ly end in thoſe of his Mercy: and that terrible Lord of Hoſts, is now this meeke God of Peace; reconciling all to one another, and Man-kinde to Him-ſelfe. S^r. in this change of Language I am no punctuall Interpreter: a way as ſervill as ungracefull. <hi>Quintilian</hi> cenſures a Painter,
<pb facs="3"/>
that he more affected Simili|tude then Beauty; who would have ſhown greater Skill, if leſſe of Reſemblance: the ſame in Poetry is condemned by <hi>Horace;</hi> of that Art the great Law-giver. Thus in the Shadow of your Abſence, diſmiſt from Arms by an Act of Time, have I, in what I was able, continued to ſerve you.</p>

But the word delivers them for <hi>Perſians,</hi> for ſo they called their Philoſophers; ſuch as were skilfull in the Coeleſtiall Motions, from whence they drew their predictions: and with whom their Princes con|ſulted in all matters of moment. Some write that they were of the poſteritie of <hi>Balaam,</hi> by his Pro|pheſies informed of the birth of Chriſt, and appariti|on of that narrative Starre: but more conſonant to the Truth, that they received it from divine inſpi|ration.</p>
               <p>Ver. 34. My Starre] None of thoſe which adorne the Firmament; nor Comet, proceeding from con|denſed Vapors inflamed in the Aire; but above Na|ture, and meerely miraculous: which, as they write, not onely illuminated the eye, but the underſtanding; excited thereby to that heavenly inquiſition. Some will have it an Angel in that forme. The excellen|cie whereof is thus deſcribed by <hi>Prudentius.</hi>

               <p>It is apparent by his Teſtament to his Scholar <hi>Muſaeus</hi> (whereof certain verſes are recited by <hi>Iuſtin Martyr)</hi> that his opinion in divinitie was in the main agreeable with the ſacred Scri|ptures: As of one God, the Creator of Heaven and Earth, the Authour of all good, and puniſh|er of all evil; exhorting him to the hearing and underſtanding of that knowledge which was revealed from Heaven: meaning nothing elſe by thoſe various Names which he gives to the Gods, but divine and naturall Vertues: ſha|dowing God himſelf under the Name of Iupi|ter to avoid the envy and danger of thoſe times; as is almoſt evident by theſe attributes.</p>

               <p>VErſe 30. O may they periſh, &amp;c.] This impre|cation comprehends thoſe following cala|mities which the Divine Vengeance inflicted on the <hi>Iews:</hi> more, and more horrid, then ever be|fell any other Nation.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 35. Let the great in Warre, &amp;c.] <hi>Titus Ve|ſpaſian:</hi> who beſieged <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> when almoſt all the <hi>Iewiſh</hi> Nation was within the Walles, there met to celebrate the Paſſeover: who took it by force, conſumed the Temple with fire, (which fell on that day in which it was former|ly burnt by the <hi>Chaldeans)</hi> and levelled the City with the ground: eleven hundred thouſand <hi>Iewes</hi> there periſhing by famine, peſtilence, and the ſword: another hundred thouſand Captives were publikely ſold, for a <hi>Romane</hi> penny a <hi>Iew;</hi> and ſixteene thouſand ſent to <hi>Alexandria</hi> for ſer|vill imployments: two thouſand of the moſt beautifull and perſonable young men reſerved to attend on his Triumph, who after, to delight the Spectators, were torne in pieces by wild beaſts in the <hi>Amphitheater.</hi>

Verſ. 26. Let Diſeaſes ſow, &amp;c.] During the ſiege the Peſtilence violently raged, proceeding from the ſtench of dead bodies, to whom they afforded no buriall, but piled them up in their houſes, or threw them over the Wall of the City.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 41. Famine, in their dry entrailes, &amp;c.] Vn|expreſſible was the Famine they indured; and pittifull, if they themſelves had had any pitty: enforced to ſeeth their Girdles and Shooes, and fighting fiercely with one another for ſo courſe a diet. Driven in the end to that exigent, that they were faine to rake the ſincks and privies, and to feede on that which was loathſome to be|hold; neither could they keep what they found from the rapine of others.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 44. The Babe re-enter her, &amp;c.] Hunger had ſo overcome Nature, that a Woman of riches and honour, named <hi>Mary,</hi> being daily rob'd of her proviſion by the Seditious, ſlew her owne childe which ſuckt at her breſt, and having ſod|den one halfe thereof, eat it. When at the ſent of fleſh, they broke in upon her; who preſented them with the reſt; the theeves then hardly re|fraining, though they trembled at ſo horrid a Spectacle.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 45. While yet the eager Foe, &amp;c.] The ene|my aſſailed them without, and the Seditious
<pb n="121" facs="64"/>
maſſacred one another within; divided into three parties: the Zealous, the <hi>Idumaean</hi> Rob|bers, and the reſt of the mutinous Citizens: but upon every aſſault of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> ſetting their private hatred aſide, united themſelves, as if of one Minde, and with admirable courage repulſed the Enemy: but upon the leaſt ceſſa|tion renewed their bloudy diſcord; ſome be|ginning with their owne hands to ſet the Temple on fire.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 47. Let th'Enemy, &amp;c.] See the Notes up|on the 35. Verſe.</p>
               <p>Verſe. 50. The Reliques of their ſlaughter,] In the dayes of <hi>Adrian,</hi> the <hi>Iewes</hi> raiſed a new Com|motion: of whom his Lieutenant, <hi>Iulius Seve|rus,</hi> ſlew five hundred and foure ſcore thouſand; tranſporting the reſt into <hi>Spaine</hi> by the com|mand of the Emperour: ſo that <hi>Iewry</hi> was then without <hi>Iews,</hi> as it continues to this preſent.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 52. Deſpiſ'd, and wretched, wander, &amp;c.] Out of <hi>Spaine</hi> they were baniſhed in the yeer 1500. by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Emanuel.</hi> Now ſcattred throughout the whole World, and hated by thoſe among whom they live; yet ſuffered as a neceſſary miſchiefe: ſubject to all wrongs and contumelies; who can patiently ſubmit them|ſelves to the times, and to whatſoever may ad|vance their profit.</p>

Verſ. 53. Aboliſh'd by their Law, &amp;c] This they loſt in the deſtruction of their City. Yet daily expect that Meſſias who is already come: and, as they beleeve, ſhall reſtore them to their tem|porall Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 55. This infected ſoyle, &amp;c.] The Eccle|ſiaſticall Hiſtories report, how <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Ari|mathea,</hi> after he had ſuffered impriſonment by the envy of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and was delivered by an Angel, left his Countrey, and ſailed to <hi>Marcel|lis</hi> in <hi>France:</hi> from thence paſſing over into this Iland, he preached the Goſpell to the <hi>Brittaines</hi> and <hi>Scots:</hi> who there exchanged this life for a better.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 95. Who knows but ſoone a holier Age, &amp;c.] <hi>Helena</hi> the Mother of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> throwing downe the Fane of <hi>Venus,</hi> which <hi>Adrian</hi> had erected on <hi>Calvary,</hi> covered both the Mount and Sepulchre with a magnificent Temple, which yet hath reſiſted the injuries of Inſolence and Time: and what was before without, in reverence to the place, is now in the heart of the City. To recover this from the <hi>Saracens,</hi> divers of the Weſterne Princes have unfortunately ventured their Perſons and People: though <hi>Godfry</hi> of <hi>Bullein,</hi> with an Army of three hun|dred thouſand, made of the City and Country an abſolute Conqueſt: Whoſe Succeſſours held it
<pb n="123" facs="65"/>
for foureſcore and nine yeers, and then beaten out by <hi>Saladine</hi> the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Sultan. Yet yeer|ly is the Sepulchre viſited, though now in the poſſeſſion of the <hi>Turke,</hi> from all parts of the World by thouſands of Chriſtians, who there pay their vowes, and exerciſe their Devo|tions.</p>

               <p>Verſ. 139. Not that fierce Prince, &amp;c.] <hi>Herod</hi> the Great, the murderer of the Infants: who put three of his ſonnes to death; with his wife <hi>Mari|amme,</hi> whom he frantickly affected.</p>
               <p>Verſ. 140. Nor his Succeſſour, &amp;c.] <hi>Herod An|tipas,</hi> who cut off the Head of <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt.</hi>
