                     <p>I would my Parents had kept me up as birds in dark|ness, when they are taught to sing Artificial Tunes, that my ears only might have been imploy'd; and as those Teachers whistle to birds several times, so would I have had Tutors to have read to me several Authors, as the best Poets, the best Historians, the best Philosophers, Moral and Natural, the best Grammarians, Arithme|ticians, Mathematicians, Logicians, and the like. Thus perchance I might have spoke as eloquently upon every subject, as Birds sing sweetly several tunes; but since my Education hath been so negligent, I wish I might do some no|ble Action, such as might raise a monumental Fame on the dead Ashes of my Fore-fathers, that my Name might live everlastingly.</p>

                     <p>The truth is, all Suters do worship with an Idolatrous zeal, but their zeals tire at length, as most zeals do, and men are content to be com|manded, whilest they are Courting servants, and do obey with an industri|ous

care, and with an humble and respectful Demeanor, a submissive and awful Countenance, with an admiring and listning Ear, pleasing and ap|plausing Speech, insomuch as their Mistris might think they commanded not only their Senses, but also their Souls; yet after they are maried, they be|come from being servants, to be Masters, and they are so far from obeying, as they command, and instead of an humble and respectful demeanour, and an awful countenance, they will be haughty and surly, and their faces will be cloathed in frowns, and instead of an admiring eye and a listning ear, they will neither regard nor take notice of their Wives, unless it be to throw a scornful glance, and instead of a pleasing and applausing speech, they will reprove, discommend, or threaten. Thus, although they serve as Slaves when they are wooing Suters, yet they rule as Tyrants when they are Husbands, as all Slaves do that come to rule, prove Tyrants, like as the most fierce zealous Supplicants oft-times prove Atheists, or Reprobates.</p>

                     <p>You speak for Lovers, but there is a difference betwixt Court|ship and Love; for dull Love is contented to be entertained only with plain truth, and is constant to an honest heart, but sprightly Courtship delights in extravagancies, lives in varieties, but dies in particulars or singularities.</p>

                     <p>Why, he is a slave that lives not under such government; for what greater slavery is there than to be tyed to one woman? I am sure our Fore-fathers, who were godly men, were not tyed to such slavery; they had
<pb n="251" facs="137"/>
their liberty as the <hi>Turks,</hi> and such like wise governments, a to have as ma|ny Wives and Mistresses as they please, or at least as many as they can maintain.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Censure.</speaker>
                     <p>Although you may think that government wise, because it fits your Appetite, yet well-tempred men, 'tis likely, will be of another opini|on, as to think the strict Canon-Laws of <hi>Europe</hi> are better for the good of Common-wealths, and every particular Family, by restraining one man to one woman, than to let them have more, or as many as they will.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sensuality.</speaker>
                     <p>If well-temperd men be of that opinion, they are fools, which I will soon prove them to be. As first for the Common-wealth, there is no|thing more disadvantagious; for those Commonwealths flourish with great|est glory, that are fullest populated, by reason populated Kingdomes are strongest, both for their own defence, and against Forein Enemies, as being able to conquer others by Invasions, inlarging their Dominions with their numbers, increasing their numbers with their numerous issues, begot and born from their many Wives, Concubines, and Slaves: when by our niggardly laws Kingdoms become uninhabited and barren for want of men to till and manure the ground: And as for our Wars, they'd seem as private Chal|lenges, and our Armies as particular Duellers, being met with their Se|conds to decide their petty quarrels, and to shew their valour by the ha|zard of their lives, and our Battels seem slight Skirmishes, or like a Company or Rout that kill each other in an idle Fruy. Thus in comparison of other Em|pires, all <hi>Europe</hi> is but as one Kingdom, for numbers of men, and Martial Forces, when by the Extent it may be accounted the fourth part of the known World. And as for particular Families, want of children breeds discontent, and not only destroys industry, but makes spoil and unthrifts; for those that have no children, they care not what becomes of their goods, lands, or livings, spending them through cluelesness, or through riot: And as for Women, it spoils them from being good wives; for being sole Mi|strisses, having no Co-partners, nor Shares, neither of their Husbands, chil|dren, or estates, and being the only She that is served or attended, imbraced, loved, or maintained, grows proud, imperious, insults and domineers, and disputes with her Husband for preheminency, and the truth is, for the most part, obtains it. Thus men become slaves to the distaff for quietness sake, o|therwise there is such quarrels and brawleries, that his house and home, that should be his Couch of Ease, his Bed of Rest, his peaceable Haven, or haven of Peace, is for the most part his couch of thorns, his bed of cares, his hell of torments, or tormenting hell, and his whole Family are like a tempestuous Sea, where Passions hurl into Factions, and rise in waves of discontent: But when men have an absolute power over their wives, they force them into quiet obedience; and where men have many Wives, Con|cubines, and Slaves, the women are humbled into a submission, each woman striving which should be most serviceable, and who can get most love and favour; and as for Bastards, they are as much the Fathers children, as those that are got in Wedlock.</p>

                     <speaker>Censure.</speaker>
                     <p>But it is likely that Concubines and slaves will be false, and fa|ther their children on those that never begot them.</p>

                     <p>Why so may Wives, and 'tis most probable they do so; but as other Nations do allow many Wives, Concubines, and slaves, so they give men power and rule to govern and restrain them; and the men are so wise in other Nations, as they suffer no other men but themselves to come

                     <p>Goodmorrow young Ladies, you appear this morning like sweet-smelling flowers, some as Roses, others as Lillies, others as Violets, Pinks, and Primroses, and your associating in a company together, is like as a Posie which Love hath bound up into one Bucket, which is a sit Present for the Gods.</p>

                     <speaker>Bon' Esprit.</speaker>
                     <p>If you would have us presented to the Gods, we must die; for we are never preferred to them but by Death: wherefore we must be gi|ven to Death, before the Gods can have us; they may hear us whilest we live, and we may hear of them, but partake of neither until we die.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Heroick.</speaker>
                     <p>O that were pity, Ladies; for there is nothing more sad in Na|ture, than when Death parts a witty Soul from a young beautiful Body, be|fore the one hath built Monuments of Memory, and the other gained Tro|phies of Lovers: And as for the Gods, you will be as acceptable to them when you are old, as when you are young.</p>

                     <speaker>Ambition.</speaker>
                     <p>As nothing could make me so sad as untimely death of Youth, Wit, and Beauty, so there is nothing could anger me more, as for Fortune to frown upon Merit, or not to advance it according to its worth, or to bury it in Oblivion, hindring the passage into Fames Palace.</p>

                     <speaker>Temperance.</speaker>
                     <p>For my part, I believe Death will neither call nor come for you before his natural time, if you do not send Surfet and Excess to call him to take you away.</p>

                     <speaker>Pleasure.</speaker>
                     <p>Indeed Mankind seem as if they were Deaths Factors; for they
<pb n="255" facs="139"/>
do strive to ingross and destroy all other creatures, or at least as many as they can; and not only other creatures, but their own kinde, as in Wars; and not only their own kinde, but themselves, in idle and unprofitable Adven|tures, and gluttonous Excess, thus as I said, they are Deaths Factors, buying sickness with health, hoping to gain pleasure, and to make delight their pro|fit, but they are cozen'd, for they only get Diseases, Pains, and Aches.</p>

                     <p>You say right, <hi>Mother Matron</hi>; wherefore pray leave off this dis|course, for I hate to hear off death; for the thoughts of death affright me so, as I can take no pleasure of life when he is in my mind.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Heroick.</speaker>
                     <p>Why Ladies, the thought of death is more than death himself; for thoughts are sensible or imaginable things, but Death himself is neither sensible nor imaginable.</p>

                     <speaker>Heroick.</speaker>
                     <p>Then by my consent, Ladies, your discourse shall be of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Cupid,</hi> which are Themes more delightful to your Sex, and most contra|ry to death; for Love is hot, and Death is cold; Love illuminates life, and Death quenches life out.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Bon Esprit.</speaker>
                     <p>Let me tell you Sir, Love is as apt to burn life out, as Death is to quench it out, and I had rather die with cold, than be burnt with heat; for cold kills with a dead numness, when heat kills with a raging mad|nesse.</p>

                     <p>But Lovers are tormented with fears and doubts, which cause cold sweats, fainting of spirits, trembling of limbs; it breaks the sweet re|pose of sleep, disturbs the quiet peace of the mind, vades the colours of beau|ty, nips or ●lasts the blossome of youth, making Lovers look withered, be|fore Time hath made them old.</p>

                     <p>Faith Sir the house is too unwieldy to stir, and Monsieur <hi>Busie</hi> is too Active to stay at home: but the truth is, I went at four a clock this mor|ning, because I would be sure to find him and his servants, and their Master was flown out of his nest an hour before: Then I told his servants I would come about dinner-time, and they laugh'd, and ask'd me what time was that? I said I supposed at the usual time, about Noon, or an hour before or after, but they said their Master never kept any certain time of eating, be|ing full of business. Then I asked them what time that would be when he would come home to bed: They answered, that his time of Resting was as uncertain as his time of Eating. Then I pray'd them to tell me at what time they thought I might find him at home: They said it was impossible for them to guess, for that their Master did move from place to place, as swift as thoughts move in the Mind. Then I pray'd them that they would tell him when he came home, that you would desire to speak with him: They told me they would, but they did verily believe he would forget to come to you, by reason his head was so full of busie thoughts, or thoughts of business, as there was no room more for a thought to stay in. So I went away in despair, but coming home, I chanced to see him at a little distance, so I made all the haste I could to overtake him, placing my Eyes fixedly upon him, because I would not lose him; but his pace was so swift, and his several turnings in se|veral Lanes and Allyes were so many, as it was impossible for me to keep my measure, pace, or sight, for like a Bird, he did not only fly out of my reach, but out of my view; but by a second good fortune, I met him just at your Gate, and I stopp'd his way until I had told him your Message, which was, you would speak with him: He answered me, he could not possibly stay, for his businesse called him another way. I told him, that if he did not come and speak with you, or stay until you did come and speak with him, his Law-sute, which was of great Importance, would be lost, for you could not do him any further service to your Friends, that should help him, until he had resolved you of some questions you were to ask him; besides that, you wanted a Writing that he had. He told me that he was very much obliged to you for your favour to him, but he could not possibly stay to speak with you, for he had some businesse to do for two or three other men, and he must of necessity go seek those men out whom the businesse concerned; so that I could not perswade him by any means, although for his own good, to come in, or to stay till you went to him.</p>

Thus his busy thoughts do tire his Mind, so that his life hath a sorry, sore, and weary Journey.</p>

                     <p>Not to my Eyes; for I never see a tall big woman, but I think she rather proceeds from the race of <hi>Titan</hi> than <hi>Iove,</hi> for she seems to be more Body than Soul, more Earth than Flame.</p>

                     <p>Faith all Women, especially Ladies, their natural humour is like the Sea, which will be neither quiet it self, always ebbing and flowing, nor let any thing be at rest on it: I know not what the Fishes are that are in it, but for any thing I can perceive to the contrary, they live in a perpetual motion: So doe Ladies; for their Passions and Affections ebb and flow from object to object; for one while they flow with love, then ebb with hate, sometimes they are rough with anger, and stormy with rage, then indifferent calm with patience, but that is seldome: But in the Spring-tide of Beauty they overflow all with pride, and their thoughts, like Fishes, are in a perpe|tual motion, swimming from place to place, from company to company, from one meeting to another, and are never at rest.</p>

                     <p>O that I might enjoy those pleasures which Poets fancy, living in such delight as nature never knew; nor that all Poets did write of me, not only to express their Wit, but my Worth, and that I might be praised by all mankind, yet not vulgarly, as in a croud of others praises, but my praises to be singularly inthron'd above the rest, and that all others commendations might have no other light but what proceeds from the splendor of my Fame: Also I wish that Nature had made me such a Beauty, as might have drawn the Eyes of the whole World as a Loadstone to gaze at it, and the splendor thereof might have inlightned every blind eye, and the beams therefrom might have comforted every sad heart, and the pleasing Aspect therein might have turned all passions into love; then would I have had Nature, For|tune, and the Fates, to have given me a free power of the whole World, and all that is therein, that I might have prest and squeezed our the healing Bal|somes, and sovereign Juices, and restoring Simples into every sick wounded and decayed body, and every disquieted or distemper'd mind: Likewise, that I might have been able to have relieved those that were poor and necessitous, with the hidden riches therein, and that by my power I might not only have obliged every particular creature and person, according to their worth and merit, but to have made so firm a peace amongst mankinde, as never to be dissolved.</p>

                     <p>I am so far from being an Enemy to the Effeminate Sex, as I am the best friend they have: for I do as a friend ought to do, which is, to tell them truth, when other men deceive them with flattery.</p>

<pb n="265" facs="144"/>
Wherefore they must be such as are well born, well bred, well behav'd, modest, and of sweet dispositions, virtuous, and of strict life, other|wise they are not for me; and if I find them not so, I shall soon turn them away.</p>

                     <p>Why Madam, even <hi>Diana</hi> her self, as severe and strict as she was, had some wanton Nymphs, that would commit errours; although they seem|ed all sober and modest, and profess'd chastity, yet they would slip out of the way and her presence sometimes.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Superbe.</speaker>
                     <p>But she never failed to turn them out of her service, and some she cruelly punished; so that what her severity could not prevent, yet her severity did punish; for <hi>Diana</hi>'s practice was not to watch her wanton Nymphs, nor to hunt out their evil haunts, or lurking-places, to see their evil actions, but her practice was to hunt the more modest and temperate creatures, which were the beasts of the Fields and Forests: So, like as <hi>Diana,</hi> I shall not watch my Maids, nor pardon their rude or dishonourable actions.</p>

                     <p>You mistake madness; for madness is not caused by the quickness of motion, but by the irregularity of the motion: And as for Poe|tical and Musical Motions, although they are quick, yet they keep Time, Time and Order, when those Motions that cause madness do not: But the quick-moving brains of Poets are caused by their lively &amp; elevated Spirits, which are Active and Industrious, always creating for delight or profit, as Verses, Fan|cies, Scenes, Sonnets, or inventing Arts: And if you account these Ingenious and Divine Spirits to be mad, I shall desire to be mad too, as they are.</p>

caused by the Poetical and Harmonical spirits, but some other defects of the brain, or distemper of the spirits; but there are many mad, that are so far from Poetical Fancies, or Musical skill, or Inventions, as they can neither conceive the one, or learn the other, or understand either; but Musick and Poetry have oft-times cured madness, and certainly are the best and most ex|cellent Physicians for that disease: For though madness is but one and the same disease, as madness, yet the Causes and Effects are divers.</p>

                     <p>It rather causeth madness to have outragion: Effects; but a cold brain may be mad: But it is neither heat nor cold that causeth mad|ness, but the irregularity of the Spirits.</p>

                     <p>But heat and cold may cause the irregularity of the Spirits: for as cold Livers make the Veins like standing ponds, which putrifies the blood for want of motion; so very cold Brains may be like Snow or Ice, to obstruct or bind the Spirits, hindring the regular motions.</p>

                     <p>I must marry, or bury succession in my Grave; but it's dange|rous, very dangerous. O Nature, Nature, hadst thou no other way to Create a man, unless thou mad'st a woman! But if thou wert forc'd by the Fates to make that Sex, yet thou hadst liberty to make her of a constant Mind; but thou art inconstant thy self, as being of female kind: But since I must marry, Discretion shall make the Choise, which will choose Virtue before Wealth, Wit before Beauty, Breeding before Birth; if she hath Virtue, she will be Chaste; if she hath Wit, she will be Conversable, if she hath good Breeding, she will be modest and well-behav'd. But where is that woman that is virtuously Chaste, wittily Conversable, and Modestly-behav'd? If any woman be thus, as I would have her, it is Madamoiselle <hi>Bon' Esprit,</hi> she seems to have a Noble Soul by her Honourable Actions, which women, for the most part, are so far from, as they seem, for the most part, to have no souls at all, by their mean and petty actions: Also she hath a Supernatural Wit, I mean supernatural, as being a woman; and her Wit is not only Ingenious, but Judicious, by which she will set a value on subjects of Merit and Worth, and despise those that are base; when fools know not how to prize the best, but chuse that is bad, not knowing what is good, so walk in Errours ways, which leads unto dishonour; but she, having Wit and Honour, knows the benefit of Honesty so well, as she will be Chaste for her own sake, were it not for her Husbands. But I most satyrically have tran|slated her sweet and harmless mirth, which was presented in her Elevated Verse into a wanton Interpretation. <hi>Diana,</hi> thou Goddess of Chastity, par|don me! But stay thoughts, whither wander you? let me examine you be|fore you pass any farther, as whether or no you are not led by the bow-string of <hi>Cupid,</hi> or the girdle of <hi>Venus,</hi> into the foul paths of vain desires, and del●|ding beauty, to the labyrinth of destruction, there to be kept and incaptivated by the intanglements and subtill windings, and turnings, and various passa|ges of Amorous Love? But a strict Examination requires Time, and a just

                     <speaker>Ambition.</speaker>
                     <p>I can: And first for Valour. Have you gone to the Wars, and fought? why, millions do the like, and a poor Common Souldier will venture for sixpence on that which a vain Cavalier will hardly do to gain an immortal Fame: Or peradventure you have fought Duels, why every Drun|kard will do as much, who in their drink they not reason to consider Valour, which is only to fight for the sake of Honour; but most commonly Duels are fought through Anger, or Fear, or Scorn, or Revenge, or the like, which is not true valour, but they fight rather like beasts than men, as with Force, Fu|ry, or Appetite, caused by natural Antipathies, or through the heat of the blood, or desires or dislikes of the Senses: whereas true Valour is just, tem|perate, patient, prudent, and is the Heroick part, or Virtue of the Soul: And to be valiant, is to fight for the right of Truth, and the defence of Inno|cency, without Partiality, Covetousness, or Ambition: Also to prove your self Valiant, have you received misfortunes with patience, and suffred tor|ments with fortitude? Have you forgiven your Enemies, or spared a bloo|dy Execution for humanities sake, or releas'd rich prisoners without Ran|some, and poor without slavery? Have you heard your self slanderd with Patience, justify'd your wrongs with Temperance, fought your Enemies without Anger, maintained your Honour without Vain-glory, then you are Valiant.</p>
                     <p>And for Wisedome, what do you call Wisedome? to speak Hebrew, Greek, and Latine, and not understand them? or to understand them, and cannot speak them? Or to cite dead Authors? Or to repeat their Learned Opinions? Or to make Sophisterian Disputes? Or to speak Latine Senten|ces? Or to tell stories out of Histories? Or to write several Hands? Or to spell with true Orthography? Or to talk of the Sciences, but study none? Or to talk of Morality, but practice none? This you may call Learned, but not Wisedome. But to be Wise, Have you settled a Kingdome in peace, and put it in order, when it was imbrovled with Civil Wars, or insnared with confused and intangled Laws? Or have you appeased a mutinous and half-starv'd Army? Have you led an Army with Order, pitchd a Field with Art,
<pb n="280" facs="152"/>
fought a Battel with Prudence, or have made a safe and honourable Retreat? Or have you been so provident, as to relieve Famine with fore-stor'd provi|sions? Or to prevent misfortunes with fore-sight? Or have you distinguish|ed a Cause clearly, or given an upright Judgment? Or have you delivered judicious Counsel, and given seasonable and suitable Admonitions? Have you composed a Common-wealth, or made profitable Laws to uphold a Com|mon-wealth? Have you defended a Common-wealth from Enemies, or purged a Common-wealth from Factions? Have you made Officers worthy of Imployments, Magistrates able to Govern, Souldiers skilful to Com|mand? Have you sitly matched men and business, and offices with men? Have you imploy'd the idle, and given light to the ignorant? Have you dis|charged a Common-wealth of Superfluity, or superfluous Commodities, and brought in those which are more useful, such as they have wanted? Have you Manured a barren Country, or inrich'd a poor Kingdome? Have you made honest Associats, faithful Agreements, and safe Traffiques? Then you may think your self Wise, and be silent; for the Actions will proclame it.</p>
                     <p>Also what do you call Wit? Imitating Extravagancies like a Jackanapes, or a Buffoon, to extort the Countenance with making wry faces? Or with much laughter to shew the teeth, which perchance are all rotten in the head? Or foolishly to divulge the infirmities of particular persons in an open As|sembly? Or putting Innocency or Youth out of Countenance? Or to di|sturb the Serious with idle Sports? Or disorder the Wise with foolish and rude Jests? Or do you all Wit affected Dresses, affected Garbs, affected Countenances, or vain-straind Complements, or uselesse Words, or senslesse Speeches, or crosse Answers, or impertinent Questions? But for your Wit, Hath your Fame flown beyond <hi>Euripides, Homer,</hi> or <hi>Ovid,</hi> your Descrip|tions beyond <hi>Horace,</hi> or your Verse beyond <hi>Virgil</hi>? Have you Oratory to e|qual the Orators of <hi>Athens, Lacedemonians,</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi>? or have you devised any Ingenious Inventions, or produced any profitable Arts, or found out any new Sciences? Then you are Witty.</p>
                     <p>Likewise what do you call Honesty? to live luxuriously to your self, not medling, nor intermingling your self and home-Affairs with the publick Af|fairs of the World? To keep open House at <hi>Christmass?</hi> To give your scraps to the poor? To pay Wages duly, Debts justly, Taxes quietly? To kisse your Maids privatly? And although all this is good and commendable, but the kissing of your Maids, yet it is not enough to make a perfect honest man: But to be perfectly honest, Have you temperd your unfatiable Appetite with Abstinency, moderated your violated passions with Reason, governed your unruly actions with Prudence? Have you not exacted unjustly, judged par|tially, accused falsly, betrayed treacherously, kept wrongfully, took forcibly? but have you advanced Virtues, defended the Innocent? Have you witnessed for Truth, pleaded for Right, and stood for the defenceless? Then you are perfectly Honest.</p>
                     <p>Also what do you call Generosity? To give a present to a lewd Mistris? To bribe a corrupted Judge? Or fee a subtil Lawyer? Or feast the vain Courtiers? Or maintain Sycophants and Flatterers? Or Bail a just Arrest? Or to be bound for the Deboist? Or to give Ladies Collations? Or to lend or give idle drunken fellows money? Or to give when you think to hear of it again? This is Prodigality, not Generosity. But to be Generous, Have you set your prisoner free, Ransomed the Captives, or bought off the chains
<pb n="281" facs="152"/>
of the Gally-slaves? Have you maintained young Orphans, or helped poor Widows? Have you cheered the Aged, nourished the Hungry, succoured the Infirm, relieved the Distressed, comforted the Sorrowful, and guided the Ignorant? Or have you upholden an Antient Family from sinking? Then you are Generous.</p>
                     <p>As for your Person, the more Handsome and Beautiful you are, the more Effeminate you seem. But to conclude, That man that hath a narrow Heart, and a mean Soul, that only seeks his own delights, which all vain-glorious persons do, I will not marry: For Noble Ambition hath a heart, whose veins with bounty flow, and wears her life only for Honours use and Vir|tues need.</p>

                     <p>To seem very modest, is to appear simple; to be much reserved, is to be formal, which is only fit for State-Ladies; to be very civil, is to be too humble, and appears mean, and only fit for Country wives.</p>

Well, I will neither ask pardon, nor make excuse, nor yet justifie them; but in plain language declare my pure Affections, honest Desires, and honourable Re|quests; if she believes the first, approves the third, and consents to the se|cond, I hope to be happy, if not, I must be content: for it is a folly to mourn, when it brings no remedy.</p>

                     <p>I should sooner be jealous of a Widow, than spightful to a Ma|ried Wife: for most Wives are in a condition to be pity'd rather than en|vy'd;

                     <p>I hope she is not in such a condition to be pitied: for pity is a kin to scorn, as near as Cousin-germans, for reproach and shame are brother and sister, and scorn is the son of reproach, and pity is the daughter of shame: But although the Small Pox may set marks of deformity, they set none of dishonour; they only mark the Body, not the Soul; and that is only to be accounted shame, and to be asham'd of, as the infirmities of the Soul, for which they may be pitied.</p>

                     <speaker>Ambition.</speaker>
                     <p>Baseness only deserves scorn, and not infirmities, loss, or mis|fortunes; but there is a difference betwixt infirmities, losse, misfortunes, baseness, and wickedness. Infirmities proceed directly from Nature, Losse from Possession, Misfortunes from Interpositions, Baseness from that creature called Man, and Wickedness from Devils: The first is caused by the care|lesness of Nature, the second by the lack of Power, the third by the ne|cessity of Fate, the fourth by the corruption of Man, the last by the per|swasion and temptation of the Devil. The first, second, and third are not to be avoided, the fourth not to be practised, the fifth not to be followed nor fostered. The first is to be pitied, the second to be grieved for, the third to be lamented for, the fourth to be scorned, and the fifth to be hated and ab|horred. Thus we may grieve for the loss of her Beauty, but not pity her, having no natural defect in the Soul, which is the Understanding, and the Rational part.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Superbe.</speaker>
                     <p>They are so: for one can never discover an ill Poem, until the Rhimes be dissolved into Prose, which shews whether there be Sense, Reason, Wit, or Fancy in them.</p>

                     <speaker>Ambition.</speaker>
                     <p>But to be turned into Prose, the Poems will lose the Elegance of the Style, and the Eloquence of the Language.</p>

                     <p>Why, if a man should lose his Hat and Feather, and be stript of a fine and gay Suit of Cloaths, he would neither have the less brain nor blood, nor soul, nor body, beauty nor shape; and though gay and glorious Appa|rel may allure the Eyes of a young Lady, or a Novice Gentleman, or may draw the ignorant vulgar to Admiration, and so to an Esteem and Respect; yet those that have clear Understandings, solid Judgments, quick Wits, and knowing Wisedoms, will be so far from admiring the man for the sake of his gay Cloaths, or esteeming him for his glorious Attire, as they will be apt to condemn him as a vain man.</p>

                     <p>Verse is to be accounted of for the sake of Numbers, which is harmonious; yet neither Harmonious Numbers, nor Chyming Rhymes, nor Gay Rhetorick, is Reason, Wit, nor Fancy, which is the Ground, Body, or Soul of a good Poem.</p>
