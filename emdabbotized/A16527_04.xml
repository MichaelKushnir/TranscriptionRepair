                  <head>The Argument.</head>
                  <p>_AT that time when the <hi>Romans</hi> trauelled with an vnſatiable ambition to ſubdue all Nations, by whoſe ouerthrow they could conceaue any ex|ſpectation, either of glory, or profit: <hi>Caius Iu|lius Caeſar,</hi> a man of a loftie minde, and giuen to attempt great things, aſcending by ſeuerall degrees to the Conſullſhip, procured a power to warre against the <hi>Gaules:</hi> amongſt whom, after a number of admirable battels and vi|ctories (by the approbation of all the world; hauing purchaſed a ſingular reputation, both for his courage and skill in Armes) he being long accuſtomed to command, was ſo drunken with a delight of ſoueraigntie, that diſdaining the ſimplicitie of a pri|uate life, he was ſo farre from denuding himſelfe of the autho|ritie that he had, that altogether tranſported with a deſire of more; hee ſent to the <hi>Senate,</hi> to haue his gouernment of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> prorogated for fiue years which ſute being repugnant to the Lawes, (as directly tending to tyrranie) was by the people publikely repelled. By which occaſion, and ſome others, riſing from an aemulation betweene him and <hi>Pompey</hi> the great, pretending a high indignation, hee incontinent croſſed the Alpes, with ſuch forces (though few) as he had in readineſſe, and with a great celeritie came to <hi>Rome,</hi> which hee found a|bandoned by <hi>Pompey,</hi> in whom the <hi>Senate</hi> had repoſed their truſt, whom ſhortly after, by a memorable battell in the fields of <hi>Pharſalia</hi> he diſcomfited▪ and hauing by the ouerthrow of <hi>Scipio,</hi> death of <hi>Cato,</hi> and flight of <hi>Pompeys</hi> ſonnes,
<pb facs="147"/>as it were, rooted out all the contrary faction, hee returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> and indirectly by the meanes of <hi>Antonius,</hi> laboured to be proclaimed king▪ which hauing rendred him altogether odious; <hi>Caius Caſſius, Marcus Brutus, Decius Brutus, Publius Ca●ca,</hi> and diuers others (Noble men) conſpired his death, and appo nted a day for the ſ●me: at which time, not|wi●hſtanding that <hi>Caeſar</hi> was diſſwaded from going foorth, by many monstrous apparitions, and ominous preſages; yet being perſwaded by <hi>D●cius Brutus Albinus,</hi> hee went towards the fatall place, where the <hi>Senate</hi> was aſſembled.</p>
                  <p>The Conſpirators in like maner, had many terrors amongſt others, <hi>Portia</hi> the wife of <hi>Marcus, Brutus,</hi> although ſhe had inſinuated her ſelfe in her husbands ſecret, by a notable proofe of extraordinary magnanimitie, yet on the day dedicated for the execution of their deſigne, through the apprehenſion of his danger ſhe fainted diuers times, wh●reof <hi>Brutus</hi> was aduerti|ſed, yet ſhrinked not, but went forward with his confederats to the appointed place, where they accompliſhed their purpoſe, euery one of them giuing <hi>Caeſar</hi> a wound, and me a ground wherevpon to build this preſent Tragedie.</p>
