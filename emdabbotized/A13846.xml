         <argument>
            <p>_THe King and Queenes Maiesty having signified their pleasure to haue a new Maske this New yeare, Master <hi>Inigo Iones</hi> and I were employed in the In|vention And we agreed the subiect of it should be a Triumphe in <hi>ALBI|POLIS</hi> the chiefe City of <hi>ALBION.</hi> The Triumpher, <hi>ALBANACTVS,</hi> And <hi>ALBA</hi> this Ilands Goddesse. Names not improper, eyther for the Place, or for the Persons: <hi>ALBION</hi> being (as it once was) taken for <hi>England; AL|BANACTVS,</hi> for the King, <hi>Quasi in Albania natus: Borne in Scotland.</hi> And <hi>ALBA,</hi> for the Queene whose native Beauties have a great affi|nity with all Purity and Whitenesse. The Kings
<pb n="2" facs="3"/>
devoting himselfe to this Goddesse, is but the seeking of that happy Vnion which was preor|deyned by the greatest of the Gods. <hi>IOVE</hi> there|fore sends downe <hi>MERCVRY</hi> to <hi>ALBA,</hi> to acquaint her that he had decreed a Tryumph, which (a farre of) she might behold: Concea|ling his further Councells, vntill <hi>ALBANAC|TVS</hi> were subdued to Love and Chastity, by <hi>CVPID</hi> and <hi>DIANA,</hi> who descend, and having conquerd the Conquerer, They shew him the Queene. The King, yeilds, And presents himselfe a Suppliant, to the Goddesse <hi>ALBA.</hi> She embraces him, And makes him Copartner of her Deity.</p>

               <p>The first thing that presented it selfe to the eye, was the Ornament that went about the Scene: in the middest of which, was placed a great Armes of the Kings, with Angels holding an Emperiall Crowne, from which hung a Drapery, of crimson Velvet, fringed with gold, tackt in severall knotts, that on each-side, with many folds, was wound about a Pillaster; in the
<pb n="3" facs="3"/>
freeze, were festones of severall fruites in their na|turall colours, on which, in gratious postures lay Children sleeping; at each end was a double sheild, with a Gorgons head, and at the foot of the pillasters, on each side, stood two Women, the one young, in a watchet Robe looking vp|wards, and on her head, a paire of Compasses of gold, the poynts standing towards Heaven: the other more ancient, and of a venerable aspect, ap|parreled in tawney, looking downewards; in the one hand a long ruler, and in the other, a great paire of iron Compasses, one poynt whereof, stood on the ground, and the other touched part of the ruler. Above their heads, were fixt, comper|timents of a new composition, and in that over the first, was written <hi>Theorica,</hi> and over the second <hi>Practica,</hi> shewing that by these two, all works of Architecture, and Ingining have their perfe|ction. The Curtaine being suddenly drawne vp, the first Sceane appeared, which represented a <hi>Romane Atrium,</hi> with high Collombs of white Marble, and ornaments of Architecture of a com|posed maner of great proiecture, enricht with car|ving, and betweene every retorne of these Col|lombs, stood Statues of gold on round pedestalls, and beyond these, were other peeces of Archi|tecture of a Pallace royall.</p>

Over all was a serene skie, out of which a cloude began to breake foorth, and as it discen|ded, a person was discovered, sitting in it, which by his Petasus and Caduceus, was knowne to be <hi>Mercury,</hi> the messenger of <hi>Iove.</hi>

                  <p>I am not angry, but a little short-winded vpon oc|casion. Yet to give you some satisfaction because you have done me wrong. Before CAESAR March't Captive Kings, with their hands bound. And Ladies, with their Armes acrosse, furious wild Beasts, great Giants, and little Dwarfes with Lictors, and Pictors, and a number of Prie●ts that were as you would have them, In their shirts. These with certaine Princes that were behind him: made vp a Triumph too great to come out of any mortall mans mouth.</p>

                  <p>I confesse thou hast made more haste, then good speede: But for a supplement to thy lame Story, Know, I have seene this brave ALBANACIVS CAESAR, seene him with the eyes of vnderstanding, vew'd all his Actions; look't into his Mind: which I finde armed with so many morall vertues that he dayly Conquers a world of Vices, which are wild Beasts indeede.</p>
                  <p>For example Ambition, is a Lyon; Cruelty, a Beare; Avarice, a Wolfe. Yet He subdues them all. To be short, no Vyce is so small, to scape him: Nor so great, but he overcomes it: And in that fashion he Triumphes overall the Kings, and Queenes that went before him. All his Passions, are his true Subiects: And Knowledge, Iudgment, Merit, Bounty and the like, are fit Comma ders, for such a Generall, Th●se Triumph with him, And these are the Princes you saw about him. And this <hi>Publius,</hi> is more then you can finde in the streete.</p>
