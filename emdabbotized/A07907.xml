            <p>_BEcauſe our preſent conceit,
reacheth vnto the antiquitie
of <hi>Brytaine,</hi> which (in many

thought it not vnneceſſary,
(being thereto earneſtly ſo|licited)
to ſpeake ſomewhat
concerning the eſtate of this our Countrey, euen
from the very firſt originall, vntil her honourable
attaining the name of <hi>Brytannia,</hi> and then laſtlye
how ſhe became to be called <hi>England.</hi> Moſt Wri|ters
do agree, that after the Deluge,<note place="marg" anchored="true">A〈…〉o|ment〈…〉 lib. 〈…〉de 〈…〉.</note>
               <hi>Noah</hi> was the
ſole Monarch of all the World, and that hee deui|ded
the dominion of the whole earth to his three
ſonnes: all <hi>Europe</hi> with the Iſles therto belonging
(wherein this our Iſle of <hi>Brytaine</hi> was one among
the reſt) fell to the lot and poſſeſsion of <hi>Iaphet</hi> his
third ſonne. <hi>Samothes</hi> the ſixt ſonne of <hi>Iaphet,</hi>
               <note place="marg" anchored="true">Wolfangus Lazius.</note> cal|led
by <hi>Moſes Meſech,</hi> by others <hi>Dys,</hi> had for his por||tion

<hi>Brytons,</hi> who were not then ſo called, but <hi>Samothe|ans,</hi>
after the name of <hi>Samothes.</hi> Of <hi>Bardus,</hi> whoe,
according to <hi>Beroſus,</hi> was very famous for inuen|ting
of Muſicke and Duties, came an order of phi|loſophicall Poets or Heralds, called <hi>Bardi,</hi> after his
owne name, whoſe excellent qualities were of ſuch
power, as they coulde enforce armies of Enemies
ready to fight fierce battell, to ſtand at a gaze, and
forbeare their cruell intent, vntil theſe <hi>Bardes</hi> lefte
ſinging, and went out of the battel: According to

her: Firſt, not any one of them was ſo named, nei|ther
do I thinke the ſtorie ſo authentical, but doe
hold <hi>Albions</hi> name for the trueſt.</p>
            <p>The Country thus peopled with Giantes, and
continuing after the name of <hi>Albion</hi> for 600. years:
<hi>Brute,</hi> (being directed by a viſion in his ſleepe, to
finde out a country ſcituated in the <hi>Weſt)</hi> with the
remaines of his <hi>Troyan</hi> folowers, arriued and Lan|ded
at the hauen now called <hi>Totnes,</hi> the yeare of the
world, 2850. after the deſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> 66. be|fore
the building of <hi>Rome</hi> 368. and 1116. before
Chriſts natiuity. He, ſearching the land ouer from
ſide to ſide, found it to be very fertile, and inhabited
by vnciuil, monſtrous huge men of ſtature, tear|med
Grants, whom he with his bolde and reſolued
companions ſlew and deſtroyed. One of them na|med
<hi>Goemagot</hi> or <hi>Gogmagog,</hi> exceeding the reſt in
ſtrength and courag, <hi>Brute</hi> cauſed <hi>Corineus,</hi> one
of his confederates, to wraſtle with the ſaid <hi>Goe|magot</hi>
at a place beſide <hi>Douer,</hi> where the Grant
hapned to break a tib in the ſide of <hi>Corineus,</hi> which
ſo ſharply incenſed him, that redoubling his power
to win the victory, he threw him headlong downe
from off one of the Rocks, which place was after
called <hi>Gogmagogs leape</hi> The Gyant being thus diſ|patched,
in reward of this honourable piece of ſer|uice,
<hi>Brute</hi> gaue vnto <hi>Corineus</hi> a part of his lande,
which according to his name, was, and yet is vnto
this day, caled <hi>Cornwall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="4"/>
               <hi>Brute</hi> thus hauing the whole Land in his owne
quiet poſſeſsion, began to build a citty, neer to the
ſide of the Riuer <hi>Thameſis,</hi> in the ſecond yeare of
his raign, which he named <hi>Troynouant,</hi> or as <hi>Hum|frey
Lhoyd</hi> ſaith,<note place="marg" anchored="true">G●l. Mon.</note>
               <hi>Troinewith;</hi> which is, newe <hi>Troy:</hi>
in remembrance of that famous citty <hi>Troy,</hi> whence
hee and his people (for the greater part) were deſ|cended.
Now beganne he to aiter the name of the
Iland, and according to his owne name, called it
<hi>Brytaine,</hi> and cauſed all the inhabitantes to bee na|med
<hi>Brytons,</hi> for a perpetuall memory, that he was
the firſt bringer of them into this land. In this time
he had by his wife faire <hi>Innogen,</hi> daughter to King
<hi>Pandraſus</hi> king of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> three worthy ſonnes,
the firſt named <hi>Locrine,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Camber,</hi> and the
third <hi>Albanact,</hi> to which three (not long before his
death) he deuided his whole kingdome in ſeuerall
partitions, giuing to <hi>Locrine</hi> all that part which we
know beſt by the name of <hi>England,</hi> then tearmed
by him <hi>Loegria</hi> or <hi>Logres.</hi> To <hi>Camber</hi> he limitted
the Countrey of Wales, called <hi>Cambria</hi> after his
name, and demded from <hi>Loegria</hi> by the riuer of <hi>Sa|uerne.</hi>
To <hi>Albanact</hi> his third ſonne, he appointed
al the North part of the Ile, lying beyond the Ri|uer
of <hi>Humber,</hi> then called <hi>Albania,</hi> now <hi>Scotland;</hi>
and to that Riuer then <hi>Albania</hi> did reach. But ſince
that time, the limits of <hi>Loegria</hi> were enlarged, firſt
by the proweſſe of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> then by our owne
conqueſts, that the <hi>Tvvede</hi> on the one ſide, and
the <hi>Solue</hi> on the other, were taken for the principal
<pb facs="4"/>
boundes betweene vs and <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After <hi>Brute,</hi> I finde not any other alteration of
our Countryes name, vntill the raign of King <hi>Ec|bert,</hi>
who about the yeare of Grace 800. and the
firſt of his raigne, gaue foorth an eſpeciall Edict,
dated at <hi>Wincheſter:</hi> that it ſhoulde be named <hi>An|gles</hi>
Land, or <hi>Angellandt,</hi> for which (in our time)
we do pronounce it <hi>England.</hi> Nor can <hi>Hengyſt</hi> the
<hi>Saxon</hi> be the Father of this latter name, for <hi>Ecbert,</hi>
becauſe his anceſtors deſcended from the <hi>Angles,</hi>
one of the ſixe Nations that came with the <hi>Saxons</hi>
into <hi>Britaine,</hi> (for they were not all of one, but of
diuers Countries, <hi>viz: Angles, Saxons, Germains,
Switzers, Norvvegians, Iutes,</hi> otherwiſe tearmed
<hi>Iutons, Vites, Gothes,</hi> or <hi>Getes</hi> and <hi>Vandales,</hi> and all
comprehended vnder the name of <hi>Saxons,</hi> beca〈…〉
of <hi>Hengiſt</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> and his company, that firſt
arriued here before any of the other) and thereto
hauing now the Monarchy and preheminence, in
manner of this whole Iſland, called the ſame after
the name of the country, from whence he deriued
his originall. So that neither <hi>Hengiſt,</hi> nor anye
Qu. named <hi>Angla,</hi> or deriuation <hi>ab Angulo,</hi> is to
be allowed before this ſounde and ſure authoritye.
Thus much briefely concerning the names of our

<hi>Iames. Thameſis,</hi> as Queene of all <hi>Britaines</hi> riuers,
begins the triumphal courſe of ſolemne reioyſing.
Next her, <hi>Sauerne,</hi> that took her name of <hi>Sabrina,</hi>
begotten by <hi>Locrine</hi> on faire <hi>Elſtrid,</hi> and both mo|ther

from <hi>Humber</hi> king of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> who being pur||ſued
by <hi>Locrine</hi> and <hi>Camber,</hi> in reuenge of theyr
Brothers death, was inforced to leap into that Ry|uer,
and there drowned himſelfe, of whom I finde
