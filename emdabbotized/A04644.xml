            <p>THe King, and Queenes Maiesty, hauing giuen their command for the Inuention of a new argument, with the whole change of the <hi>Scene,</hi> wherein her Maiesty, with the like number of her Ladies, purposed a presentation to the King. It was agreed, it should be the celebration of some Rites, done to the Goddesse <hi>Chloris,</hi> who in a generall counsell of of the Gods, was proclaim'd Goddesse of the flowers, according to that of <hi>Ouid,</hi> in the <hi>Fasti.</hi>

            <p>The ornament, which went about the <hi>Scene,</hi> was composed of Foliage, or leaues heightned with gold, and enterwouen with all sorts of flowers; and naked children, playing, and climbing among the branches; and in the midst, a great garland of flowers, in which was writ|ten, <hi>CHLORIDIA.</hi>

The Curtaine being drawne vp, the <hi>Scene</hi> is discouer'd, consisting of pleasant hills, planted with young trees, and all the lower bankes a|dorned with flowers. And from some hollow parts of those hills, Fountaynes come gliding downe, which, in the farre-of Land-shape, seem'd all to be conuerted to a riuer.</p>
            <p>Ouer all, a serene skie, with transparent clouds, giuing a great lustre to the whole worke, which did imitate the pleasant <hi>Spring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVhen the Spectators had enough fed their eyes, with the delights of the <hi>Scene,</hi> in a part of the ayre, a bright cloud begins to breake forth; and in it, is sitting a plumpe Boy, in a changea|ble garment, richly adorn'd, representing the mild <hi>Zephyrus.</hi> On the other side of the <hi>Scene,</hi> in a purplish cloud, appeareth the <hi>Spring,</hi> a beau|tifull Mayde, her vpper garment greene, vnder it, a white robe wrought with flowers; A gar|land on her head.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Zephyrus</hi> begins his dialogue, calling her forth, and making narration of the Gods decree at large, which shee obeyes, pretending, it is come to Earth already: and there begun to bee
