                        <p>Not altogether so ill; but beaten he is and robb'd, turn'd out of doors naked, at mid-night; h'as lost six hundred crowns in gold, besides a Watch, Rings and Seals; the Guard brought him to our house, to see who knew him; 'twas such a sight to see him come in torn and bloody; and yet no man durst pity him, or laugh at him; he storms yet, and will not endure a Question; he struck the Porter for asking him who abus'd him.</p>

Else, if you cannot have two penny loaves for a penny, to wear it, By my troth, I would not be committed to such a Prison as that Doublet and Collar, those shooes too, with the toes longer then the soles; I would wear the stocks as soon, and I think sit as easie in them.</p>

They're twigs of those Rods that jerk'd you so lately; and the Jest stings still so much, that I dare say, thou wilt not endure the sight, nor sound, of Don this moneth. Alass, 'tis ordinary; We see Children that have been frighted with a Cat in the cradle hate the poor Beast for ever; And 'tis to be hop'd, you may come to hate a whore too in time; by that a Fardingale has us'd you as ill as a man in a great belly'd Doublet has done: But for thee, <hi>Fred,</hi> thy dislike is as <hi>Pannick</hi> as his fear who dy'd the next day at the sight of a past danger; So thou tremblest at what's to come, and apprehend'st being couzen'd and beaten to night: You know where you are to go; take heed, it comes with a fear, especially with a Countrey-gentlemans fear; Your <hi>Essex</hi> man in <hi>Madrid,</hi> their prophetick Phantasies make their Dreams Visions still.</p>

                        <p>That's a Quarrel all your Sex has against us, though most un|reasonable; <hi>Thomaso</hi> urg'd it yesterday; and he upbraided me with selling of our selves. 'Tis truth, and the same Answer serves you both, when either of you set a price upon your selves; If I have a mind to you I'll pay it, and purchase you; Ours were a fine trade, if we kept shop, and gave our Wares for Love; would it turn to ac|count, think you, to dress and hire this House, and venture our Bodies, and Souls, to receive all that would enter?

                        <p>I urg'd not that, as a displeasure, that took any Root, only an unkindness, which is blown over; though I wonder to hear you are a Lover, the Insensible being as vulgar, as the fair <hi>Angellica.</hi>

                        <p>'Tis but the wonder of a Day; A heart I have, Sir, like other Women too, though no man had wit to find the way to win it; He is dearer to me then all the Earth besides; and if you love me you will not hate him, you cannot embrace me single; My brest is full of <hi>Thomaso;</hi> 'tis his, and Loves Nest.</p>

No, Sir, he that loves me loves and hates as I do; My Friend will pro|tect me, and revenge my wrongs; 'Tis not the purchase of my bed that tells me you love; that's your pleasure; Mine is to see you smile when I smile, and embrace what I embrace; and I know there has pass'd nothing between you and <hi>Thomaso</hi> but what may with honour enough be forgotten; as if you were the first that love and anger had blinded; what is there so ordinary as to find those Passi|ons throw friends upon the swords of Friends?</p>

<pb n="394" facs="200"/>
having had the honour to be known to you formerly, I venture upon the score of a Gentleman and a Souldier that once was com|manded by you; to whom 'tis known, I left neither the service, nor the Country with blushes; which will be enough, I hope, to pre|vail with you to forget the accident of yesterday, in which I am only guilty of having so late call'd to mind a person whom I'll so much honour as I shall ever do Don <hi>Pedro.</hi>

                        <p>No, in earnest; a meer chance: you know, yesterday I resolv'd to put my self into the habit of the place, and this morn|ing when I was dress'd and call'd for my Perriwigs, there was none but black ones in the Box; my man mistook when we parted at <hi>Paris,</hi> and put up my Comrades Box for mine; and to make the chance a jest, <hi>Harrigo</hi> dy'd my Eye-brows and Beard, as you see; and our chief Plot was to try if you could find it out.</p>

Kind|ness and faith to my Lover, good nature and charity are the height of our ambition; and 'tis one comfort, that heaven is easier satisfi'd then men; who think this fault of ours a gallantry in them, a sin so light they sing and dance under it all their days; a sin so tam'd by custom that few or none hide it, as if honour had no pretence below a mans Girdle; so his heart be right all is gallant; chaste men ridiculous, neither believ'd, esteem'd or trusted by either sex, scarce held of honour if once branded with that stain; Nay, the contrary, both sexes admires him who has the potent'st arms, and gives the frequent'st and mortal'st wounds in <hi>Venus</hi> wars; while women are so slav'd with custom, that vertue, parts, nor fortune can heal the wound in us, though Nature, Love and Kindness give it; for which, but that I know we shall have other judges of that well natur'd sin, and never a man of you all be of the jury, I would eat bran ere any he that breathes in breeches should come between my sheets.</p>

What partial folly then is that governs the minds of men; and what fools are women to submit to their Lunacy? I prize my self as high for having enjoy'd a gallant man, as you would do for having won his sword, or a gallant womans heart; despis'd because enjoy'd by others! tell me, to morrow, if you find any paths or steps upon my body where former Lovers trod, or any print of pass'd kisses cleaving to their lips; if you can miss those Graces, those Roses they gather'd, and find not as fresh and full handfulls for you to reap, as if he or they had not found their harvest.</p>

                        <p>I doubt not, Madam, but you have virtue enough to di|gest the worst of these their homely pleasures, which reach only to the body; but 'tis sin to consent to slave the mind; for how will she rejoyce or exercise her nobler faculties when that comes in question; all that have ingenuity must subscribe; wherein can the soul busie her self in the Country; but in studying of Simples, and preparing Medecines for nasty Surgery? and perhaps, kill more by errour and mistake, then your charity can expiate; then to suffer the affliction of such grounded ignorance, such resolute folly, such natural dullness as most Country-families are haunted with.</p>

                        <p>When? by Moon-shine? I am sure you dare not meet Signior <hi>Sol</hi> abroad, unless you'l come home, like Rose-cakes from a Still, bak'd and sweating; which though your dew be sweet (as common civility will make us allow that) yet 'tis troublesome and a new sight to meet Ladies abroad, when the dogs cry as they pass the streets, when to walk in your Court but two turns is evi|dence for chastity, and out-does the old Law <hi>Ordeal:</hi> 'Tis enough for your <hi>Alphonso</hi> and his Indian breeding to endure such stabs as the Sun strikes in the Dog-days; 'tis true, they say he will beat the hoof in his woollen-hose, till his feet sweat and stink more then a hunted Bores, and are fain to be steep'd at night as long as the Beef, ere they be fresh again; this commonly out of freedom is done in my Wives Chamber; and if he be kind, and dares trust you, perhaps he desires you to cut his Corns and dress his Issue, signs of favour I can assure you; and such as you must not hope, unless your woman be out of the way; and that honour being pass'd, the Gyant stretches himself, yawns and sighs a belch or two, stales in your pot, farts as loud as a Musket for a jest; and then throws himself under the Rug, and expects you in his foul sheets, and aspit|ting cloath, where hangs as much of his Lungs as remains in his body; and ere you can get into the bed he calls you with a snore or two; and are not these fine things in a Ladies bed? who would not rejoyce to meet his woollen-waste-coat and knit-night-cap without a lining? a shirt so nasty a cleanly Ghost would scarce appear in at the latter day; for his linen is a kin to him ere he
<pb n="401" facs="203"/>
puts it off; thus prepar'd for delight you Ladies meet your Coun|try-husbands; the <hi>Alphonso,</hi> high shooes; and there lye and suffer them to abuse you as often as they please to use you, which you'l too late repent; and there you may lye and sight whole nights away, he'l snore and snore till it be day under the same covers, and in the same bed his forefathers liv'd and dy'd in, and some so lately you may smell the very earthiness of the Corps still; and 'tis a better savour then his arms or breath, a stink compos'd of vile Tobacco and dead Wine, stuffed nose, rotten lungs, and hollow teeth, half whose number has been drawn with dry Cheese, and tuff lean beef; yet this man you must kiss; nay, you must kiss none but this, and muzzle through his beard to find his lips; and this you can submit to for threescore year for a joynture; which you must purchase too; for he sells you that and this Paradise, his bed, for the price of your portion only; and in strict sence you give him so much to lye with him as long as he lives; for unless he dies you have nothing but a place in his Family, and so has his dog, who shall have a pension as well as you; for in these bargains of Wed|lock the Wife is to the portion only the handful over measure; a Chattle that he takes to stock his Family, as other Cattle to stock his ground; nay, perhaps he's a blade too, and then you may spin at home, while he is abroad with <hi>Phillis</hi> in the field; by which you find, the <hi>Alphonso</hi>'s are as subject to the ills you dread, as the <hi>Thomaso</hi>'s; only, as I said before their differences is, the <hi>Al|phonso</hi>'s are more nasty lusts, and cheaper Whores, and the sin more dirty there then in the City.</p>

What cares Don <hi>Alphonso</hi> for you or your opinion? sick or well, live or dye, he's prepar'd; the funeral cloke is brush'd and laid up for the good day; and if you dye, 'tis upon your own account, for he is sure of your Portion; and your Joyn|ture serves again, never the worse for wearing; and will bait the hook for some other fool to bite at.</p>

whom you affect, though at price of your fortune, then to be chaf|fer'd or sold to slavery by friends, who only think upon joyning wealth to wealth; with my friend you command as much as you must obey there; Don <hi>Thomaso</hi> has seen the world, and gather'd from every Nation what is excellent, and can comply with times and natures, for he has been bred in Courts and Armies, those schools of the mind, where men learn to tame their wills and pas|ons; for Princes are to be studied and obey'd, not disputed with; with him you'l know no cause of dispute; with the other you must expect perpetual civil war, a sullen, rude, louring, willful, scow|ling clown, from whom if you escape blows, 'tis well; an unhew'd rudeness, whose very kindness bruises; that when he but stroaks or flatters his dogs, they cry, This will seek and bring all that is pleasure home, either in humour or conversation, to divert you; the one will devoure this youth and beauty that flows with such grace in every form and feature in that lovely body and diviner face, like common food, for his dull appetite, without a thought or value of the feast you set before him; while Don <hi>Thomaso</hi> with awe and respect and faithful kindness from a ravish'd soul enjoys you. <hi>Alphonso,</hi> Don <hi>Indian!</hi> By this light, he thinks he's trading at <hi>Gamba</hi> still, and would sell you, himself, that Bell and Bauble for your youth and fortune; 'tis his last venture, and you'l make a voyage if he catch you.</p>

                        <p>Faith, Madam, and Marriage is one disease which women are necessitated to pass; for an old Maid is an evil without a re|medy; an ill husband may be cur'd by a divorce, but there's no flying the other curse; a kind husband is the best cordial you can provide against infection of Marriage; and if you should be sick or sad (which heaven defend) <hi>Thomaso</hi> would so divide your griefs with a kind sense of what you suffer, so pity your pain, so feel all your griefs, that you will find sadness vanish, and sickness it self decay, while health, perfect health, by kindness charm'd, returns; and you'l find so much more pleasure to walk with such a friend in one of his descriptions of a Garden‚ñ™ then in twenty of <hi>Dameta</hi>'s Orchards; and read in his relations the Histories of persons, times and places; And such such minds, Madam, and such men, are fit for such Brides as the Gentle <hi>Serulina;</hi> and they only make happy Hymens; the rest but joyn the sex and beast together; and such sordid coupling is base and mean, and the herds afford as good Nuptials; this advantage Colonels (Madam) that have wit and breeding may pretend above those who have nothing good but their Bond and Joynture. Your servant, Lady; my hour is out, and so much shall serve for this time.</p>

                        <p>SO, now I am a little at peace; 'tis some consolation to my minde, the hopes of a Revenge; would my Cloaths were come home, that I might quit my Fresco; yet this time I may waste to my advantage, by contemplating and Philosophying upon my own misfortunes; a young handsome Whore to use me thus! a young Dissembler must be an old Witch; if I had got my Night for my money it would never have grieved me; how like a Boat|swain I am cloath'd, and I have a heart now as hard as any the Galley breeds; I grow malicious too, and am mad, to see <hi>Thoma|so</hi>'s fortune; The Rogue is so succesful; All Trumps turn of his Suit still; That black Periwig (a mischance as we thought, and laugh'd at) has got as good Fish as any Hook he threw into the

Sea, this Voyage; Well, all I beg of Fortune is, but to send some one of the Sex into my power; Any thing in Petticoats, that may be at my mercy: By this light, a Cat at <hi>Tower-wharf,</hi> or a Cavalier at <hi>Westminster,</hi> a Whore in <hi>Bridewell,</hi> or a Bear at Stake in <hi>Whit|sontide,</hi> shall finde more mercy than I'll shew her: How many ways have I kill'd that <hi>Sanco</hi> and <hi>Lucetta</hi> over, in my minde, since last night? I'll send for a Bottle of Consolation; what cordial comfort, I and counsel too, have I found in Sack! I shall be mad, if I stay at home, and think upon my injuries, without it; here's a damn'd Book too tells me how to avoid such accidents now when 'tis too late; by which I finde, 'tis not amiss sometimes to read as well as hawk or hunt; and yet 'tis some comfort to finde some others have been ill us'd before me; and now I have no|thing to do I'll pass my time with other mens injuries, and learn all the causes I can to hate this damn'd Nation, and the false sex.</p>

And in a Lover your crime is greater then ours; and the neglect you have shewn her a higher offence then what we kneel for; our Insolence was a chance, and proceeded from Ignorance and passion; for had we known her, we would have sacrific'd our lives for her, rather then have acted or suffer'd the least of those Crimes. But you that have the Honour not onely to be known, but esteem'd by her, to be thus long in Town, and never pay your own duty, nor inform us how we might pay ours, it makes it our faults your guilt; You shew'd us all the Whores in Town, and were mad till you had seen them your self; But, for this noble Lady, I never heard her mention'd in <hi>Madrid;</hi> Had you paid that respect your Heart knows due to her, we might have had, by such a visit, the Honour of being known to this Lady; which would have given her Protection, and secur'd our Innocence. Do you blush? 'Tis time; and if you had any grace, this Truth would be a Ring in your Nose, as well as the other in ours. Good severe, small Friend, am I with you?</p>

A gray Wanderer is but a bad Tragedy to himself, though an old Beggar may be a Comedy to others: These thoughts, and the noble nature of this vertuous Maid, have made me resolve to abjure this humour; and having bid farewel to all the follies of my youth vow my whole thoughts to the friendship of the fair <hi>Serulina;</hi> a maid, whose Dower and Beauty may satisfie an avaritious heart and a wandring eye; yet those

Our houses may be haunted with Wonderers; but we are sure to finde no Lovers there; for my small Bird is so lean she's neither good in the Field nor Bed, which makes me securenone of <hi>Cupid</hi>'s Falkoners will fly at her; And for <hi>Ned</hi>'s, I would fain see him that dares attempt her Honour either by force or flattery.</p>

                        <p>I am not troubled now; But you cannot expect to finde the mind quiet assoon as the Reason; The Alarm my fears took cannot be so soon compos'd; you must allow some time to place a|gain what the storm disorder'd; 'Tis but a Minute since I found my self miserable; and this change of happy Fortune had like to have finish'd with Joy the dangers which despair begun; Nor shall I find a perfect peace till my Brother and you are friends; and here I make it my first suit to you, that you will for my sake bear with his Passion; And as he by an Extravagant Anger may express the value of a Sister he conceives lost; so you will shew your Esteem of me, by bearing patiently his Injury.</p>

                        <p>Alass Gentlemen, I am not too blame; your wine and kindness made me forget some Rules; I shall never love Mace, nor tope again; I told you then my brain was weak, nor am I faulty; I did my part, and prepar'd your Baths fit for my experiment; A nobler work had never been done, nor prouder Subject of my Art will never be shewn, had not that cursed Wine made us forget to limit the operation and proportion in the charm, to such or such a form; you should have nam'd some body for similitude or shape; you should have seen what miracle our skill would have perform'd; But I too late, remember your dispute, (which was handsomest) held you so long in resolving, drinking to this, and admiring that Beauty, till you forgot to resolve on one whose name but call'd on in the Charm had stood the form or mould to have cast your wives in. And now when Wine and delay, (your own Crimes) have un|done us all, unjustly you punish the chance on me, though your nwo Heart knows the Charm was of high force, and wrought but too effectually.</p>

she knows the way to this House, and so shall I if not restor'd.</p>

                        <p>Sir, there are none here but what are in the pot; We have no leisure to think of you nor your losses; We have business and losses of our own; Our Wives and two hundred thousand Crowns boyl'd to nothing, couzen'd and cheated by a damn'd Mountebank; but the slave is in pickle for it.</p>

                        <p>Yes, Sir; 'tis we that are couzen'd the second and third time, fools in grain, and stand fair to burnt or hang'd too; Judge then whether we are in stealing case; A pox on Bathing, I shall never love broth nor spoon-meat again; Would any man have thought liquor would have been our Enemy?</p>

Yet heaven witness, I envy not your youth her peace; for though I cannot be innocent my self, I am not so wicked but I can adore both her and vertue in the breasts of others; nor do I lament a grief that has surpriz'd me; 'tis long since my heart discover'd his; and they are fond women, who stain'd with our crimes can hope to weep gallant men into such madness as to leave the blessings the fair and vertuous <hi>Serulina</hi> brings, to blush their lives with us.</p>

Other women may be chaste, but they are so rigid and so cruel to our faults; and their counsels so full of whips and stings, it rather incenses and hardens then reclaims a heart; nor doth their ill nature care to make a convert amongst us, so they may have the vanity to make a Satyr upon us; but here I find the Balsam of true innocence; which is not so proud, or vain in her own blest condition, as sollicitous to preserve and redeem others: and here I see the true stock of honour, which in your ge|nerous breast has diviner forms and fruits then we can know or imagine in our sick state; yet I dare boast never to have broke the Laws she prescrib'd to our sex, faithful, kind, constant and obedi|ent to cur Lovers, concern'd only in their good, never betraying or abandoning their trust.</p>

                        <p>All is well, Sir; The Justices came immediately as you went out, and have seiz'd all the goods they found. But those Prodigies in the Baths has made them flie the House; Four such Gyants, Sir <hi>Amadis,</hi> nor the <hi>Palmerins</hi> ever encountred; The German guards are now in Arms to seize them, <hi>Scarramucha</hi> is come out a Lady, as big again as Don <hi>Edwardo</hi>'s; And there is a Lady come forth <hi>Scarramucha,</hi> a Gyant amongst Gyants; She doth so wonder at her Beard and Breeches, for she has <hi>Helena</hi>'s old Whores Soul in a mans Body; 'twas sport to see the wonder, and what a start she gave at the Ammunition of her own Breeches. The Mountebank keeps his own Features, but in a horrid form; and threatens black destruction to you all: His wife too is one of the loveliest forms and perfect symmetry that such a Monster can present to the judging eye; <hi>Celia</hi> in Youth and Beauty, such as when her charming Hand and Voice led <hi>Rome</hi> in Chains; Yet she is still frighted with the power of that Charm that first enslav'd her, and would hide or flie the Anger and the Love of him who now with frowns and severe looks threatens all; They quickly made the Inquisidors leave the House; which gave me occasion to tell them you were Tra|vellers, guilty onely in the trying a publick experiment; Men that had not a sold to lose, poor cashier'd Cavalliers; whom their Guardian had couzen'd of their Portions, and I'de un|dertake, for a piece of money, should quit your Interest to them; upon which they seiz'd the Guardian, and expect Don <hi>Harrigo</hi> to treat your Interest; You are sure he's in the Gallies for his Life, and his Estate confiscate to the Church; Your wives will be Prisoners during Life; for to lie with them is held Copu|lation with the Devil.</p>
