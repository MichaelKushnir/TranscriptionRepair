                     <p>Why there are but three of them, and three women cannot serve and content all the men in the VVorld.</p>

                     <l>Some being solemn, and some pleasant were</l>
                     <l>And when he spake, his person did appear</l>
                     <l>Like to the Sun, when no dark Clouds were neer;</l>
                     <l>Fame of his valour, like a trumpet sound,</l>
                     <l>Through Ears from Heart, unto the Eyes rebound;</l>
                     <l>And then his person, like <hi>Mars</hi> did appear,</l>
                     <l>Yet so, as when fair <hi>Venus</hi> Queen was neer.</l>

                     <l>Great Fortune, I at this time do implore,</l>
                     <l>That thou wilt open every hearing door,</l>
                     <l>Which are the Ears: let not my Wit be lost,</l>
                     <l>For want of bearing, nor my words be crost,</l>
                     <l>Nor yet destructed by a busling noise,</l>
                     <l>Or gazing, or observing some light toyes:</l>
                     <l>But let their Ears be sixt, as if their sight</l>
                     <l>Did view my words, till on their Ears they light.</l>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Noble and Right Honourable,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I shall take my discourse at this time out of Ignorance, which discourse, I shall divide into Five Parts, the Gods, Fates, Nature, the VVorld, and Man; for although Ignorance be obscure, and hard to be discovered, yet it is printed in a general Language, being spread and communicated over all the VVorld. I begin with the First, and prime Creature, Ignorant Man. Man takes himself to be the most knowing Creature, for which he hath placed himself next to the Gods; yet Man is ignorant: for what Man is, or ever was created, that knows what the Gods are, or how many there are? Or what power they have, or where they reside? What Man did ever know the Mansions of Glory, the Bowers of bliss, or the Fields of plea|sure? What Man ever knew whether the Gods were Eternal, or bred out of infinite, or rule, or govern, infinite Eternally?</p>
                     <p>Secondly the Fates. What Man is, or ever was, that knows the Fates? As whether they are Gods or Creatures, or whether the Fates are limited, or decree as they please? Or what Man is, or ever was, that knows the decrees of Fate, the links of Destiny, or the chance of Fortune, or the lots of Chance.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="496" facs="260"/>Thirdly. What Man is, or ever was, that knows what Nature is, or from whence her power proceeds? As whether from the Gods, or Eterni|ty, or infinite, or from the Fates? Or whether the Gods, or Fates, proceed from her? Or what at first set her to work? Or whether her work is pre|scribed, or limited? Or of what she works on? Or what instruments she worketh with? Or to what end she works for? Or whether she shall de|sist from working, or shall work Eternally? Or whether she worked from all Eternity? Or whether her work had a beginning, or shall have an end|ing? What Man knows the beginning of Motion, or the Fountain of Know|ledge, or the Spring of Life, or Gulph of Death? Or what Life is? Or what Death is? Or whether Life, Motion, and Death, had a beginning, or shall have an ending?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly the World. VVhat Man is, or ever was, that knows how the VVorld was made? Or for what it is made? Or by whom it was made? Or whether it had beginning, or shall have end?</p>
                     <p>The Fift and last is Man. VVhat Man is, or ever was, that knows how he was formed, or of what composition, or what is that he calls a Rational Soul? VVhether it is imbodyed, or not imbodyed? VVhether it is Divine, or Mortal? VVhether it proceeds from the Gods, or was created by Na|ture? VVhether it shall live for ever, or shall have a period? VVhether it shall live in Knowledge, or ly in Ignorance? VVhether it be capable of pain, or pleasure? VVhether it shall have a residing place, or no certain place assigned? Or if it have none, where it shall wander? Or if it have, where that residing place is.</p>
                     <p>As for the Body, who knows the perfect Sense of each Sense, or what mistake, or illusions, each Sense is apt to make, or give, or take? VVhat Man knows how the Body dissolves, or to what it shall dissolve? VVhat Man knows whether there be Sense in Death, or not? VVhat Man knows the motion of the thoughts, or whether the thoughts belong only to the Soul, or only to the Body, or partly to both, or of neither? VVhat Man is there that knows strength of passion? As what Faith may beget? Or what Doubts may dissolve? Or what Hopes may unite? Or what Fears may dis|order? Or what Love can suffer? Or what Hate can act?</p>
                     <p>VVhat Man is there that knows the Circumpherence of Admiration, the ri|gour of Adoration, the hight of Ambition, or the bottom of Covetousness? Or what Man knows the end of Sorrow, or beginning of Joy? And as for the Appetites, what Man knows the length and bredth of desire? As for the Senses, what Man is there, that knows the true Sense of Pleasure, or the ut|termost bounds of Pain? VVho can number the varieties of Tast, Sent, Touch, Sound, and Sight? VVhat Man knows the perfect effects of each Sense? Or what Man is there that knows any thing, truly as it is? Yet cer|tainly there cannot be an Athest; for though men may be so irrelligious, as to be of no Religion; yet their can be none so willfull, and utterly void of all Sense, and Reason, as not to believe there is a God; for though we have not the true light of knowledge, yet we have as it were a perpetual twilight; Man lives as at the poles of knowledge; for though we cannot say it is truly day, yet it is not night. Man may perceive an Infinite power, by the perfect distinctions of all particular varieties, by the orderly production of several Creatures, and by the fit, and proper shapes of every several kind of Creature; by their orderly Births, by the times and Seasons, to produce, flourish, and decay; by the distinct degrees, qualities, properties, places and
<pb n="497" facs="260"/>
motions of all things, and to, and in every thing, by the exact form of this VVorld; by the prudent seperations, and situations of the Heavens and Earth; by the Circumferent lines, and poyzing Centers; by their bounds and limits; by their orderly, and timely motions; by their assigned tracts, constant Journies, convenient distances; by their intermixing, and well tempering of the Elements; by the profitable Commerce, betwixt the Hea|vens and the Earth; by the different kinds, several sorts, various Natures, numerous numbers of Creatures; by their passions, humours, appetites; by their Sympathies, and Antipathies; by their warrs and parties; by the Harmony that is made out of discord, shews that there is onely one absolute power, and wise disposer, that cannot be opposed, having no Copartners, pro|duces all things, being not produced by any thing, wherefore must be Eter|nall, and consequently infinite; this absolute, wise, and Eternal power Man calls God; but this absolute power, being infinite, he must of necessity be incomprehensible, and being incomprehensible, must of necessity be un|known, yet glimses of his power is, or may be seen; yet not so, but that Man is forced to set up Candels of Faith, to light them, or direct them to that they cannot perfectly know, and for want of the clear light of know|ledge, Man calls all Creations of this mighty power Nature; his wise de|crees, Man calls Fates; his pointed will, Man calls Destiny; his several Changes, Man calls Fortune; his Intermixing Man calls Life; his sepera|ting, Man calls Death; the Sympathetical, and Antipathetical motions of the Senses, and their Objects, Humours, and their Subjects, Man calls Plea|sure, and Pain; the interchanging motions in Man, Men call Sense, and Knowledge; the seperating motions, Man calls Ignorance, Stupidity, and Insensibility; my application is, that this absolute Power, wise Disposer, and decreeing Creator, hath created himself Worship, in making Creatures to worship him; and it is probable, Truth decreed Judgment, Punishment, and Bliss, to such of his Creatures as shall omit, or submit thereunto: my exhoration to you is, to bough humbly, to pray constantly, to implore ser|vently, to love truly, to live awfully to the worship of this incomprehensible power; that you may injoy bliss and avoid torment.</p>

                     <p>O no, for a Coward is affraid to use a Sword, and a Valiant man is affraid to be without the use, otherwise a strong sturdy Clown, might cuff him down, and kick him like a Football on the ground, which a Sword, and skill to use it, will prevent; for a Clown hath not skill to defend, or assault a Sword, having no practice therewith, nor ought they to have; for the use of this kind of Arms makes a Clown a Gentleman, and the want of skill makes a Gentleman a Clown; for a Right bred Gentleman, is to know the use of the Sword, and it is more manly to assault, than to defend; also to know how to mannage Horses, whereby we know how to assault our Enemy as well as to defend our selves; for it is not playing with a Fidle, and dancing a Measure, makes a Gentleman; for then Princes should dub Knighthood with a Fidle, and give the stick, and a pair of Pumps, insteed of a Sword, and a pair of Spurs.</p>

                     <p>My Lord, we are so far from wearing our Swords our selves now a dayes, as we give them our Footmen to carry, as if it were a disgrace to carry a Sword our selves.</p>

                     <p>Tis true, and we are well beaten for our follies, for disarm|ing our selves, and arming our Slaves; for now a Groom is made a Gentle|mans equal, nay his Superior sometimes; for if a Groom kills a Gentle|man, the Gentleman dyes in disgrace, and the Groom lives with Honour, and gets the Fame of a gallant Person; for that is the phrase to all those that have fought, although they were forced thereto as Slaves, not distinguishing true valor, which is voluntary, temperate and just.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>Why then there should be a Decree, of Law, that none should wear Swords but Gentlemen, nor Arms allowed, but to those of approved merit.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Nobilissimo.</speaker>
                     <p>You say right, unless in time of Forein Wars, and then there should be a difference in their Arms; for if there be no difference of Arms, no difference of persons, and if there be no difference of persons, there will be no Supremacy of Power, if no Supremacy, no Royal Govern|ment; for as the Sword maintains the Prerogative of the Crown, so it doth the Honour of a Gentleman; and as the Sword keeps up the dignity of the Crown, so a Sword keeps up the Heraldry of a Gentleman; and no man ought to be accounted a Gentleman, that knows not how to use his Sword, and manage his Horse; for the one defends himself, and kills his Enemies; the other, doth front and charge his Enemy, and pursues him if need require.</p>

                     <p>For mine? why sure that is not so, for certainly you would not take that pains, and bestow so much cost, for one you do enjoy allready, for a Husband that is tied to you for life, and cannot quit on Ho|nourable terms; wherefore it is for one is loose and free, which you do strive by setting forth your self with garments rich, for to attract, and draw to your desires.</p>

                     <p>But Virtue is best acceptable, when Beauty doth present it; and Beauty finds most favour, when well attired; but were I sure you would like me better in mean Garments, and careless dresses, I then should Cloath my self in Freez, &amp; like a Hermit my loose course Garments ty with single cord about my waste; but I will go and pull these Cloaths off, since they are thought a crime, and I thought false for wearing them.</p>

                     <p>I will discourse at this time of Love, not of the superfluous Branches, or wither'd leaves, or rotten fruits, but of the Root of Love, which is Self-love; It is the Root and Original Love in Nature; it is the Foundation of Nature, it is the Fountain from whence issues all the several Springs; Self-love was the cause of the Worlds Creation; for the Gods out of love to them|selves, caused Creatures to be Created, to worship them: thus all Crea|tures being created out of self-love, and their chief being proceeding out of self-love, is the cause that every particular Creature loves themselves in the first place, and what Love is placed on any other, or to any other, from any particular, is derived from self-love; for we love the Gods but out of self-love, as believing the Gods love us; we adore the Gods but out of self-love, because we think we proceed from them, or were produced by their commands; we pray to the Gods but out of self-love, because we hope the Gods will help us in distress; we bless the Gods but out of self-love, be|cause we do verrily believe the Gods will exalt, and Crown us with everlast|ing glory; and to shew that we Love the Gods, not as they are Gods, but for our own sakes, as believing they will or can do us good, is, that we are apt to murmure at the Gods, when we have not our own desires; we are apt to accuse the Gods, when any wordly thing crosses us; we are apt to curse the Gods at ill Accidents, Misfortunes, or Natural losses; we are apt to forget the Gods in the midst of pleasure; we are apt to think our selves Gods in the pride of prosperity; we strive to make our selves Gods in the hight of worldly power; and we do not only strive to make our selves equal with the Gods, but to raise our selves above the Gods, taking, or command|ing to our selves more worship than we give unto the Gods; nay, those that are accounted the most holy and devout Servants of the Gods, belie the Gods, taking the name of the Gods to cover their own follies; as for exam|ple, whensoever any eminent person hath had ill success, either in, or after their Foolish, Ambitious, and Vain-glorious actions, they charge the Gods Decrees and pleasure, as it was the Gods will it should be so; like as she that Vaingloriously had her two and only Sons to draw her Chariot, like two Horses, or Dogs, or Slaves, and being both found Dead the next day, she had prayed to the Gods to reward them with that which was best for them, and being both dead, she said the Gods accounted Death as the best reward, when they no doubt dyed with over heating themselves, striving beyond
<pb n="503" facs="263"/>
their natural power and strength; yet these two Sonns that drew the vain Mo|ther in a Chariot, drew and died out of self-love; either like as vain Sonns like their vain Mother, vaingloriously to get a fame, or believing the Gods would reward them for their Act, either with extraordinary prosperity, pow|er, or blessedness in the Life to come; and many the like examples may be gi|ven; for how ordinary is it in these our times, and in former times, for the politicks to perswade the people, with promises from the Gods, or to tell them it is the Gods commands they should do such and such acts, even such acts as are unnatural, wicked, and most horrid? thus Men bely the Gods to abuse their fellow Creatures. But most Noble and Right Honourable, my explanation of this discourse is, that since Self-love is the Fountain of and in Nature from whence issue out several Springs to every several Creature, wherein Mankind being her chiefest and Supreme work, is filled with the fullest Springs from that Fountain, which is the cause that Mankind is more industrious, cruel, and unsatiable, to and for his self ends, than any other Creature, he spares nothing that he hath power to destroy, if he fears any hurt, or hopes for any gain, or finds any pleasure, or can make any sport, or to imploy his idle time; he melts metalls, distills and dissolves plants, dis|sects animals, substracts and extracts Elements, he digs up the bowels of the Earth, cuts through the Ocean of the Sea, gathers the winds into Sails, fresh waters into Mills, and imprisons the thinner Ayre; he Hunts, he Fowls, he Fishes for sport, with Gunns, Nets, and Hooks; he cruelly causeth one Creature to destroy another, the whilst he looks on with delight; he kills not only for to live, but lives for to kill, and takes pleasure in torturing the life of other Creatures, in prolonging their pains, and lengthning their Deaths; and when Man makes friendship of Love, it is for his own sake, ei|ther in humouring his passion, or feeding his humour, or to strengthen his party, or for Trust, or Counsel, or Company, or the like causes; if he dies for his friend, it is either for fame, or that he cannot live himself happy with|out his friend, his passion, and grief, making him restless; if Man loves his Children, Wife, or Parents, tis for his own sake; he loves his Parents, for the honour he receives by them, or for the life he received of them; if he loves his Wife, or the Wife the Husband, it is for their own sakes, as their own pleasure, as either for their Beauties, Wits, Humours, or other Graces, or for their Company, or Friendships, or because they think they love them; if they love their Children, it is for their own sakes, as to keep alive their memory, and to have their duty, and obedience, to bow and do homage to them; If Masters love their Servants, it is for their own sakes, because they are trusty, faithfull and industrious in their affairs, imploy|ments, or for their own profit, or ease; and if Servants love their Masters, it is for their own sakes, as either for their power to protect them, or for the regard they have to them, or for the gain they get from them, or for their lives that are nourished, and maintained by them; if Amorous Lovers love, it is for their own sakes, as to please the Appetite, and to satisfy their desires; if Subjects love their Soveraigns, it is for their own sakes, as that they may have Law and Justice, Peace and Unity; If Sovereigns love their Subjects, it is for their own sakes, because they bear up his Throne with their Wealth and Industry, and fight to maintain, or get him power. My Appli|cation, most Noble and Right Honourable, is, that since we do all, and in e|very act for our own sakes, we should indeavour, and study, for that which is best for our selves, and the ground of our indeavour is to learn, and know
<pb n="504" facs="264"/>
our selves, every particular person must learn and know himself, not by comparative, as observing others, for every man is not alike; but by self study, reading our own Natures and Dispositions, marking our own Passions, mours, and Appetites, with the Pen of Thought, and Ink of Examination; and let the Truth be the Tutor to instruct you in the School of Reason, in which you may Commence Master of Art, and go out Doctor of Judgment, to practise Temperance; for Temperance keeps in its full strength, prolongs Beauty, quickens Wit, ripens Youth, refreshes Age, restores Decayes, keeps Health, maintains Life, and hinders Times ruines; but Temperance is not only a Doctor of Physick; a Physician to the Body, but a Doctor of Divinity, a Divine for the Soul; It preaches and teaches good Life, it instructs with the Doctrine of Tranquillity, and guides to the Heaven of Happiness; also Temperance is the Doctor of Musick, it tunes the Senses, composes the Thoughts, it notes the Passions, it measures the Appetites, and playes a Har|monious Mind. Thus Most Noble and Right Honourable, I have proved that Self-love is the Fountain of Nature, and the Original Springs of her Creatures, and that Temperance is the strongest Foundation of Self-love, although few build thereupon, but upon Intemperance, which is a hugh Bulk of Excess, the substance of Riot, worm eaten with Surfers, rotten with Pain, and sinks down to death with Sickness and Grief, not being able to bear and uphold Life; wherefore build your Lives upon Temperance, which is a strong and sure Foundation, which will never fail; but will uphold your Lives as long as Time and Nature permits them, and your Souls will dwell peaceably, and happily therein.</p>

                        <hi>Admiration, Vainglory, Pride,</hi> and <hi>Ambition,</hi>

                     <l>Why do you woo Beauty, that is Deaf and Dumb,</l>
                     <l>That hears no praise, nor adoration;</l>
                     <l>It seeth no hands heav'd up, nor tears that fall,</l>
                     <l>It hath no tongue to answer Love withall;</l>
                     <l>It hath no Life, no Soul where passion lies,</l>
                     <l>It neither gives, nor takes instructions wise:</l>
                     <l>It is no solid Body you admire,</l>
                     <l>No substance, but a shadow you desire.</l>
