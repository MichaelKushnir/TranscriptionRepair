His sweating put me in minde of a good Shrouing dish (and I beleeue would be taken vp for a seruice of state somewhere, an't were knowne) a stew'd <hi>Poet</hi>▪ He doth sit like an vnbrac'd Drum with one of his heads beaten out: For, that you must note, a <hi>Poet</hi> hath two heads, as a Drum has, one for making, the other repeating, and his repeating head is all to pieces: they may gather it vp i' the tiring-house; for hee hath torne the booke in a <hi>Poeticall</hi> fury, and put himselfe to silence in dead <hi>Sacke,</hi> which, were there no other vexa|tion, were sufficient to make him the most miserable <hi>Embleme</hi> of patience.</p>
