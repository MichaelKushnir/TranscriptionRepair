            <head>THE Description of a Maske presented before the Kinges Maiestie at White Hall, on twelft night last, in honour of the Lord <hi>HAYES,</hi> and his Bride, daugh|ter, and heire to the Honourable the Lord DENNYE, their mariage hauing been the same day at Court solemnized.</head>
            <p>_AS in battailes, so in all other acti|ons that are to bee reported, the first, and most necessary part is the discription of the place, with his oportunities, and properties, whe|ther they be naturall, or artificiall. The greate hall (wherein the Maske was presented) receiued this diuision, and order: The vpper part where the cloth &amp; chaire of State were plac't, had scaffoldes and seates on eyther side continued to the skreene; right before it was made a partition for the dauncing place; on the right hand whereof were consorted ten Musiti|ons, with Basse and Meane Lutes, a Bandora, a double Sack-bott, and an Harpsicord, with two
<pb facs="5"/>
treble Violins; on the other side somewhat neerer the skreene were plac't 9. Violins and three Lutes, and to answere both the Consorts (as it were in a triangle) sixe Cornets, and sixe Chappell voyces, were seated almost right against them, in a place raised higher in respect of the pearcing sound of those Instruments-eighteen foote from the skreen, an other Stage was raised higher by a yearde then that which was prepared for dancing: This higher Stage was all enclosed with a double vale, so artifi|cially painted, that it seemed as if darke cloudes had hung before it: within that shrowde was concea|led a greene valley, with greene trees round about it, and in the midst of them nine golden trees of fif|teene foote high, with armes and braunches very glorious to behold: From the which groue toward the State was made a broade descent to the daun|cing place, iust in the midst of it; on either hand were two ascents, like the sides of two hilles, drest with shrubbes and trees; that on the right hand lea|ding to the bowre of <hi>Flora:</hi> the other to the house of <hi>Night</hi>; which bowre and house were plac't op|posite at either end of the skreene, and betweene them both was raised a hill, hanging like a cliffe o|uer the groue belowe, and on the top of it a good|ly large tree was set, supposed to be the tree of <hi>Di|ana</hi>; behind the which toward the window was a small descent, with an other spreading hill that cli|med vp to the toppe of the window, with many trees on the height of it, whereby those that played on the Hoboyes at the Kings entrance into the hall
<pb facs="5"/>
were shadowed: The bowre of <hi>Flora</hi> was very spa|cious, garnisht with all kind of flowers, and flowrie branches with lights in them; the house of <hi>Night</hi> ample, and stately, with blacke pillors, whereon ma|ny starres of gold were fixt: within it when it was emptie, appeared nothing but cloudes and starres, and on the top of it stood three Turrets vnderpropt with small blacke starred pillers, the middlemost be|ing highest and greatest, the other two of equall proportion: about it were plac't on wyer artificial Battes, and Owles, continually mouing: with ma|ny other inuentions, the which for breuitie sake I passe by with silence.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the place, and now from thence let vs come to the persons.</p>
            <p>The Maskers names were these, (whom both for order and honour I mention in the first place.</p>

            <p>These are the principall persons that beare sway in this inuention, others that are but secunders to these, I will describe in their proper places, discour|sing the Maske in order as it was performed.</p>
            <p>As soone as the King was entred the great Hall, the Hoboyes (out of the wood on the top of the hil) entertained the time till his Maiestie and his trayne were placed, and then after a little expectation the consort of ten began to play an Ayre, at the sound wherof the vale on the right hand was withdrawne, and the ascent of the hill with the bower of <hi>Flora</hi> were discouered, where <hi>Flora</hi> &amp; <hi>Zepherus</hi> were bu|sily plucking flowers from the Bower, and throw|ing them into two baskets, which two <hi>Siluans</hi> held, who were attired in changeable Taffatie, with wreathes of flowers on their heads. As soone as the baskets were filled, they came downe in this order, First <hi>Zepherus</hi> and <hi>Flora,</hi> then the two <hi>Siluans</hi> with baskets after them: Foure <hi>Siluans</hi> in greene taffatie, and wreathes, two bearing meane Lutes, the third a base Lute, and the fourth a deepe Bandora.</p>
