                     <p>Faith to day she hath been better than I have seen her, for she was so patient as to give order for Blacks; but I commend the young Lady Madam <hi>Iantil,</hi> who bears out the Siege of Sorrow most Couragi|ously, and on my Conscience I believe will beat grief from the fort of her heart, and become victorious over her misfortunes.</p>

                     <p>It were better for my Lady if she would marry again, that her Husband should prove a Devill than a Mortal Enemy, for you can free her from the one though not from the other, for at your words, the great Devil will avoid or vanish, and you can bind the lesser Devils in Chains, and whip them with holy Rods untill they rore again.</p>

the Masculine Sex of the Army of Reformation was much out of Counte|nance, being doubly or trebly overcome, twice by their Enemy, and then by the gallant actions of the Females which out-did them, yet they thought it best to take their advantage whilst the Victory was fresh and flourishing, and their Enemies weak and fearfull, to lay siege to the next Towns in the Enemies Country; whereupon the Lady <hi>Victoria</hi> and her Female Souldiers hearing of the Army of Reformations designs, for they had sent the men to their own Quarters as soon as the Battel was won and Victory got; Also the Masculine Prisoners they sent to the mens Quarters, not intermixing themselves with the men, but as I said they hearing the design they had to besiege the Towns were much inraged for not making them of their Coun|cils, whereupon they sent a Messenger like as an Embassadour to tell the Masculine Army they did wonder at their ingratitude, that they should for|get so much their relievers as to go upon any Warlike design without ma|king them acquainted therewith, striving as it were to steal the Victory out of their hands, but said they, since we are become victorious over our Ene|mies, and Masters, and Mistresses of the Field, by our own valiant actions and prudent conducts, we will maintain our power by our own strengths, for our Army is become now numerous, full and flourishing, formed, and conformable by our Discipline, skillfull by our practice, valiant by our reso|lutions, powerfull by our victory, terrible to our Enemies, honourable to our Friends, and a subject of Envy to the Masculine Sex; but your Army is weak and decrepid, sitter for an Hospital than for a Field of War, your power is lost, your courage is cold, your discipline disorderous, and your command sleighted, despised by your Enemies, pittied by your Friends, forsaken of good Fortune, and made subject unto our Effeminate Sex, which we will use by our power like Slaves. But when our Lord General who was recovered out of sickness, and all his Commanders about him heard this message, which was delivered in a full assembly, according as the Lady <hi>Vi|ctoria</hi> had commanded the message should be, the men could not chose but smile at the womens high and mighty words, knowing they had all sweet and gentle dispositions and complying Natures, yet they were at a stand which to be pleased at most, as in hearing them disparage their Masculine Sex, or in advancing their own Female Sex by their self Commendations, but how|soever so well pleased the men were with the womens gallant actions, that every man was proud that had but a Female acquaintance in the Female Army; but our Lord General was mightily taken with their bravadoes, and much mirth amongst the Commanders was about it; but when they were to advise what to do in the affairs of War, and the warring women, the General told them he made no question but that most men knew by experi|ence that women were won by gentle perswasions and fair promises, and not by rigid actions or angry frowns, besides said he, all noble natures strive to assist the weakest in all lawfull actions, and that he was no gallant man that submits not to a woman in all things that are honourable, and when he doth dissent it must be in a Courtly manner, and a Complemental behaviour and expression, for that women were Creatures made by nature, for men to love and admire, to protect and defend, to cherish and maintain, to seek and to sue to, and especially such women which have out-done all their Sex, which nature ever made before them; wherefore said he, 'tis fit to these wo|men above all others we should yield our selves Prisoners, not only in love but in Arms; wherefore let us treat fairly with them, and give them their own

conditions. But in the mean time the Lady <hi>Victoria</hi> thought it best not to lose ●y opportunity with talking out the time, wherefore she besieged a consi|derable Fort, a place which was at it were the Key that unlockt the passage into the heart of the Enemies Kingdome, and at this siege they were when became away, but the General and his Council had sent a Messenger unto them, but what his message was I cannot give you an account.</p>

                     <p>We are bound to curse you Monsieur <hi>Gravity,</hi> for retarding our visits to the Widows, for I told you we should come too late if we did not go before their Husbands were buried</p>

                     <p>That's all one unto us, but the noblest, youngest, richest, and fairest VVidow is gone; for though she is not promised or married, yet she is incloistered, and that is worse than marriage; for if she had been married there might have been some hopes her Husband would have died, or been kill'd, or some wayes or other Death would have found to have taken him away.</p>

                     <p>Let us comfort our selves with hopes, that it is but a Ladies humour, which she will be soon weary of, for when her Melan|choly ●it is over, she will come forth of her Cloister, and be fonder to marry than if she had never gone in.</p>

                     <speaker>Monsieur Compagnion.</speaker>
                     <p>The Devill shall kiss her before I will; besides, an old woman is thought a Witch.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Monsieur la Gravity.</speaker>
                     <p>Pish, that is because they are grown ill-favoured with Age, and all young people think whatsoever is ill-favoured belongs to the Devill.</p>

                     <speaker>Monsieur Compagnion.</speaker>
                     <p>An antient man is a comely sight, being grave and wise by experience, and what he hath lost in his person, he hath gained in his understanding; besides, beauty in men looks as unhandsome as age in wo|men, as being effiminate; but an old woman looks like the picture of En|vy, with hollow Eyes, fallen Checks, lank Sides, black pale Complexion, and more Wrinkles than time hath Minutes.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Monsieur Comerade.</speaker>
                     <p>Nay by your favour, some old women look like the full Moon, with a red, swell'd, great, broad face, and their Bodies like as a spungy Cloud, thick and gross, like our fat Hostess.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Monsieur la Gravity.</speaker>
                     <p>Gentlemen, why do you rail against antient women so much, since those that are wise will never marry such Boyes as you?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Monsieur Compagnion.</speaker>
                     <p>It is to be observed, that alwayes old Girls match themselves with young Boyes.</p>

                     <p>VVhy did you or any man else ever know a wise old woman, or a chast young woman in their lives? for the one dotes with Age, the other is corrupted with Flattery, which is a Bawd to self-conceit.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Monsieur la Gravity.</speaker>
                     <p>Grant it be so, yet it is better to marry an old doting Fool, than a wanton young Fille.</p>

                     <speaker>Monsieur Compagnion.</speaker>
                     <p>For my part, I think now it is the best way to marry none, since Madam <hi>Iantil</hi> is gone, but to live like the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> all in Common.</p>

                     <speaker>Nell Careless.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, as soon as she rises she goeth to my Lords Tomb, and sayes her Prayers, then she returns and eats some little Breakfast, as a Crust of Bread and a Draught of Water, then she goeth to her Gallery and walks and Contemplates all the Forenoon, then about twelve a Clock at Noon she goeth to the Tomb again and sayes more Prayers, then returns and eats a small Dinner of some Spoon-meats, and most of the Afternoon she sits by the Tomb and reads, or walks in the Cloyster, and views the Pictures of my Lord that are placed upon the Walls, then in the Evening she sayes her Evening Prayers at the Tomb, and eats some light Supper, and then prayes at the Tomb before she goeth to Bed, and at Midnight she rises and takes a white waxen Torch lighted in her hand, and goeth to the Tomb to pray, and then returns to Bed.</p>

                     <p>I know not, unless she is of that opinion which some have been of, which is that the Souls or Spirits of the dead rise at that hour out of their Graves and Tombs, to visit the face of the Earth, and perhaps my Lady watches or hopes to converse by that means with my Lords Ghost: for since she cannot converse with him living, she desires to converse with him dead, or otherwise she would not spend most of her time at this Tomb as she doth; but how doth thy Lady spend her time now?</p>

                     <p>Faith as a Lady should do, with nourishing her Body with good hear●y meats and drink. And though my Lady doth not pray at Mid|night, yet she converses with Spirits at that time of Night.</p>
