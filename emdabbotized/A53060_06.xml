                     <speaker>Contemplation.</speaker>
                     <p>I did imagine my self such a Beauty, as Nature never made the like, both for Person, Favour, and Colour, and a Wit answerable to my Beauty, and my Breeding and Behaviour answerable to both, my Wisdome excelling all: And if I were not thus as I say, yet that every one should think I were so; for opinion creates more, and perfecter Beauties, than Nature doth. And then that a great powerful Monarch, such a one as <hi>Alexander,</hi> or <hi>Caesar,</hi> fell desperately in love with me, seeing but my Picture, which was sent all about the world; yet my Picture (I did imagine) was to my disad|vantage, not flattering me any wayes; yet this Prince to be inamoured with this shadow for the substance sake: Then Love perswaded him to send me his Picture, which represented him to the life, being extreamly handsome, yet had a manly and wise countenance. This Picture being brought by Em|bassadours, which Embassadours when they came, treated with me about marriage with this sole Emperor, all other Kings and Princes being but Tri|butaries; receiving these Embassadours with great civility and respect, yet behaving my self with a reserved and Majestical behaviour, which the Em|bassadours observing, said, I was the only Lady that was fit to be the only Emperours wife, both for my Beauty, Carriage, and Wit: When after a modest Fear, and seeming Humility, I had reason'd against the marriage, at last by their perswasion I consented; then was there Post after Post, and Mes|senger after Messenger, sent with letters from the Emperour to me, and from me to the Emperour; he admiring my letters, for the elegancy of the stile, and eloquency of the wit, and admiring my Picture for the beauty; one while
<pb n="183" facs="103"/>
reading my letters, and another while viewing my Picture, made him impa|tient for my Company, which made him send to his Embassadours, that with all speed they should bring me away, sending to all the Princes whose King|domes I was to passe thorow, that they should guard me with Armyes, but not retard me with <hi>Olimpias,</hi> or the like, but to convey me safe and speedily: Whereupon I took my Journey (most of the Kingdome where I was born petitioning to wait on me); but by reason I could not take them all, unlesse I should depopulate the Kingdome, I would carry none, lest I should displease those that were to be left behind; but as I went out of the City where I dwelt, all the streets were strewed with dead Lovers, which had lived only on hopes, so long as I lived amongst them: But when they knew for certain I was to depart, their hopes vanished, and they dyed with despair. The Em|bassadours seeing such a Mortality, caused the Army that was my guard to march apace, and my Coaches to trundle away, thinking it was the Plague; but at last, after my Beauty had killed millions in the Kingdomes I passed thorow, I arrived at that part of the world where the Emperour was, who was a joyed man to hear of my coming, and had made great preparations a|gainst my arrival; but some few dayes before my arrival, he sent a Chariot which was made of the thinnest plated gold, because it should be light in the Carriage, but the body of the Chariot was enameled and set with pre|cious stones, the Horses trappings were only great Chains of pearls, but the horses reigns were Chains of gold, that might be strong enough to check their hot Spirits, and swift speed; as for my self, I was only cloathed in white Sa|tin, and a Crown of Diamonds on my head, like a Bride, for I was to be marryed as soon as I met the Emperour; but as I past along, all the High|wayes were beset with Crouds of people, which thronged to see me, and when they saw me, they cryed out I was an Angel sent from the Gods; but your coming spoyl'd the Triumph, and brake the Marriage.</p>

                     <p>O yes, rather than fail I would make new worlds, but this wil last me a long time in shewing you what wise Laws I make, what upright Justice I give, ordering so, as the whole world should be as one united Fami|ly; and when I had shewed my wisdome in Peace, then my thoughts should have raised Warres, wherein I would have shewed my valour and con|duct.</p>

                     <p>Why prethee, they manage time best, that please life most; For it were better not to be, than to be displeased; for there is none that tru|ly lives, but those that live in pleasure, &amp; the greatest pleasure is in the imagina|tion not in fruition; for it is more pleasure for any person to imagin themselvs Emperour of the whole world, than to be so; for in imagination they reign &amp; Rule, without the troublesome and weighty cares belonging thereto; neither have they those fears of being betrayed or usurped as real Emperours have;
<pb n="184" facs="104"/>
Besides, the whole general Race of Man-kind, may this way be the particular Emperour of the whole World, if they will; but those that desire to be Emperours any other wayes, have but sick judgements, for the mind is all, for is that be pleased, man is happy.</p>

                     <speaker>Visitant.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, well, I had rather have the Material world, than you Airy Fictions.— But confess really to me, if you should not think your self ac|curst if you were to have no other Lovers, but what your Fancy cre|ates.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Contemplation.</speaker>
                     <p>No truely, for I finding none so exact as my Fancy creates, makes all men appear worse than they are: For imagination doth like <hi>Pain|ters,</hi> which takes all the gracefullest lines, and exactest Features from two or three good faces, and draws them into one: this is the reason that there may be handsomer Pictures drawn, than any Creature born; because, Nature di|stributes and divides her Favours, as to the generality, when Painter contract them into particulars; for there was never any, unlesse born as a wonder, that hath no exceptions; besides, my Lovers which my Fancy cre|ates, never make me jealouse, nor never disturb me; come to me, and goe from me; speak or are silent as I will have them, and they are behaved, quali|fied, and adorned to my humour, also of what Birth, Age, Complexion, or Stature I like best; thus their persons and souls are created in my brain, live in my Contemplation, and are dead and buryed in my forgetfulnesse, but have a Resurrection in my remembrance,</p>

                     <speaker>Contemplation.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, the greatest pleasures that can be in Fruition, I take in Imagination: for whatsoever the sence enjoyes from outward objects, they may enjoy in inward thoughts. For the mind takes as much pleasure in cre|ating of Fancies, as Nature to create and dissolve, and create Creatures anew: For Fancy is the Minds creature, &amp; <hi>imaginations</hi> are as several worlds, where|in those Creatures are bred and born, live and dye; thus the mind is like infinite Nature.</p>

                     <speaker>1. <hi>Gent.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>She is a great Heiress, and was Ward to my old Lord, and he upon his Death-bed charged his Son my young Lord to marry her.</p>

                     <p>Surely small perswasions might serve turn; for her Virtue is Rhetorick enough to perswade, nay to force affection.</p>

                     <p>Yet my Lord is discontented, he would rather choose for him|self, than that his Father should have chosen for him; for it is the Nature of Mankind to reject that which is offered, though never so good; and to prize that they cannot get, although not worth the having.</p>

                     <p>That I cannot doe, for I love those best which I create my self, and Nature hath taught me to prize whatsoever is my own most, although of smaller valew, than what's anothers, although of greater worth.</p>

                     <p>That is past my skill; but if you will leave me alone, I will think of you when you are gone; for I had rather of the two entertain you in my thoughts, than keep you Company in discourse; for I am better pleased with a solitary silence, or a silent solitariness, than with a talking conversation, or
<pb n="187" facs="105"/>
an entertaining talking, for words for the most part are rather useless spent, than profitably spoke, and time is lost in listning to them, for few tongues make Musick, wanting the Cords of Sense, or sound of Reason, or singers of Fancy, to play thereon.</p>

                     <p>Speech is an enemy to Fancy; for they that talk much, cannot have time to think much; and Fancies are produced from thoughts, as thoughts are from the minde, and the minde which doth create the thoughts, and the thoughts the fancies, is as a Deity; for it entertains it self with it self, and only takes pleasure in its own works, although none other should par|take, or know thereof; but I shall talk a World out of my head, wherefore farewel.</p>

I came a boy to your Grandmother the great and rich Lady Natures service, she being then newly married to your Grandfather the Lord Propriety; from whence sprung your Father the Lord Morality; your Grandfather, and Grandmother dying, I ser|ved your Father, who soon after married your Mother the Lady Piety, they living, whilst she lived, with Peace and Tranquillity; but she dying, left you only to your Father, as a pledg of their loves; and indeed, you are so like them both, as all must confess they were your Parents, although they knew not your Birth; and yet none can tell which you resembled most: thus have I lived to see your Grandfather, and Grandmother, and Father, and Mother dead, and Peace, and Tranquillity fled; and you sweet <hi>Virtue</hi> left dessolate and forlorn, both of friends and fortune; but sweet Lady comfort your self, for I have a little fortune, which I got honestly in your Fathers service; and as long as that lasts you shall not want.</p>

                     <p>I had rather shrow'd my honest Poverty in a thatcht house, than live in a Palace to be pointed at for my misfortunes; for in this Age, misfortunes are accounted crimes, and poverty is condemned as a thief, and hang'd in the Chains of scorn; wherefore if I could get a service in an ho|nest poor Farmers house, I might live happy, as being most obscure from the World, and the Worlds Vices; for vice encreases more in Palaces than in Cottages; for in Palaces Pride Plows, Faction Sowes, Riot Reaps, Extortion Threshes, Covetousness Whoords up the grain or gain; there youth is corrup|ted with Vanity, Beauty catcht with Flattery, Chastity endangered with Pow|er, and Virtue slandered by Envy; besides, great Persons use their Servants too unequally, making them either Masters, or Slaves; where in an humble Cottage the industrious, and laborious Masters command their Servants friendly and kindly, and are obeyed with love; wherefore good <hi>Humanity,</hi> seek me out such a Place to live in, to serve.</p>

                     <p>Tis true Madam, for some travel meerly to learn to make a leg or congy with a good grace, and to wear their cloaths, or acouster themselves fashionably. But I have observed in my travels, that very cold Countries, and very hot Countries, have neither so many Beauties, nor so much Wit, at lest not so much as more temperate Countries have.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <p>I cannot conceive the reason, unlesse the extream coldnesse of the Climate should congele their Spirits, and stupifie their Brains, making the Spirits unactive to get, and the Brain too barren to breed and bear Wit.</p>

                     <p>Beauty, Madam, is as tender and fading in the growth, as a Flower, although it be fresh and sweet; and the more delicate it is, the more subject to be nipt with the hard Frost, and to be withered with raw colds.</p>

                     <p>Yes, if they be equally tempered with moisture; for as heat in moisture are Generators of all Creatures, so of Wit; but if the moisture exceed the heat, the Brain, or Mind becomes stupid, if the heat exceeds the moisture, the Brain or Mind becomes mad.</p>

are to be significant, copious, and smooth, and the <hi>English</hi> tongue hath the perfection of all, there being an oyle, or butter made of the cream of all o|ther Languages. Thus, what with the Temperature of the Climate, and the soft, smooth, spreading Language, <hi>England</hi> produces rarer Beauties, and eloquenter Orators, and finer Poets, than any other Nation in the world; and the Nobility and Gentry live not only in greater grandeur, than in other Na|tions, but naturally appear or look with a more splendid Great|nesse.</p>

                     <p>Sweet Lady <hi>Contemplation,</hi> although your thoughts be ex|cellent, yet there are fine curiosities and sweet pleasures to be enjoyed in the use of the world.</p>

                     <speaker>Contemplation.</speaker>
                     <p>Perchance so, but would not you think that man a Fool that hath a great estate, a large convenient house, well situated, in sweet and healthfull Aire, pleasant and delightful, having all about for the eyes to view Landskips, and Prospects; beside, all the inside richly furnished, and the Master plentifully served, and much company to passe his time with, as a re|sort of men of all Nations, of all Ages, of all qualities or degrees, and pro|fessions, of all humours, of all breedings, of all shapes, of all complexions: Likewise a recourse for all Wits, for all Scholars, for all Arts, for all Sci|ences; Also Lovers of all sorts Servants of all use, and imployments; Thus living luxuriously with all rarities and varieties, and yet shall go a begging, debasing himself with humble crouching, inslaving himself to Obligations, living upon cold Charity, and is denyed often times unkindly, or kickt out scornfully, when he may be honoured at home, and served in state, would not you think that this man had an inbred basenesse, that had rather serve un|worthily, than command honourably; that had rather be inslaved, than free? Besides, that mind is a fool that cannot entertain it self with it's own thoughts; a wandring Vagabond, that is never, of seldome at home in Contemplation; A Prodigal to cast out his thoughts vainly in idle words, base to inslave it self to the Body, which is full of corruption, when it can create bodilesse Creatures like it self in Corporalities; with which self Creatures, it may nobly, honestly, freely, and delightfully entertain it self. VVith which, the mind may not only delight it self, but improve it self; for the thoughts, which are the actions of the mind, make the soul more healthful and strong by ex|ercises; for the mind is the soules body, and the thoughts are the actions thereof.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lord Courtship.</speaker>
                     <p>Believe me Madam, I do esteem of such Riches as Money, as I do of Marriage, and in my nature I do hate them both; for a man is en|slaved by either: wherefore I would shun them if I could, and turn them out of doors, but that some sorts of necessity and conveniency inforce me to en|tertain them; the one for Posteritie sake, the other for subsistence of present life, besides convenient pleasures.</p>

                     <p>She is so, but I like her the better for that, for I would have a deadly dull Wife, and a lively Mistresse, such a sprightly Lady as you are.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lady Am.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Lord Court.</speaker>
                     <p>Certainly Madam, you onely know the Name, not the Nature, for your Nature is alwayes fresh, and sweet, and pleasant, as the Spring.</p>

                     <p>If your thoughts were so cold, your words would be as if they were frozen between your lips, all your discourse would melt by drops, not flow so smoothly and swiftly into mens eares, as they at all times do.</p>

                     <p>Tis true, I am merry when I am in your company, but in your absence I am as dull as a cloudy day, and as melancholy as dark night.</p>

                     <p>I cannot believe so well of my self, as that my company can be the light of your mirth, but I know that your company is the Sun of my life, nor could I live without it.</p>

                     <speaker>LAdy Conversation.</speaker>
                     <p>What is the reason that <hi>Mercury</hi> is feign'd to be the patron of Thieves?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Fancy Poet.</speaker>
                     <p>That is to be the patron of Scholars, for Scholars are the greatest Thieves, stealing from the Authours they read, to their own use.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lady Convers.</speaker>
                     <p>And why are Scholars counted the greatest Thieves?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Fancy Poet.</speaker>
                     <p>Because that they steal the Spirits, or life of renown, out of the treasury of Fame; when all other sorts of Thieves steal but the goods of Fortune, which is nothing but a Corporal dross.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Convers.</speaker>
                     <p>And why is he feigned the talkative God?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Fancy Poet.</speaker>
                     <p>Because Scholars talk more than other men, and most com|monly so much, as they will let none speak but themselves; and when there is a Company of Scholars together, they will be so fierce in disputes, as they will be ready to go to cuffs for the Prerogative of their opinion.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Convers.</speaker>
                     <p>The Prerogative of the tongue you mean; but why are Scholars apt to talk most?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Fancy Poet.</speaker>
                     <p>Because they overcharge their heads with several Authors, as <hi>Epicures</hi> do their Stomacks with variety of meats, and being overcharged, they are forced to vent it forth through the mouth, as the other through the gut; for the tongue, as a Feather, tickles the throat of Vainglory, vomiting out the slime of Learning, into the ears of the hearers; but some heads, as Stomacks which are naturally weak, are so grip'd, by reason it doth not dis|gest well, as they vent nothing but windy Phrases; and other brains which are hot and moist, by reason of a facil memory, disgest so fast, as they do nothing but purge loose Sentences; and other brains that are too dry and Incipid, are so costive, as their restringency strains out nothing but strong lines.</p>

                     <p>By reason the Poetical wits convert their natural defects into sweet graces, their follies to pure innocencies, and their Vices into He|roick Virtues.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sir Fancy Poet.</speaker>
                     <p>They are so; for where Nature, or Education, makes one good, or beautiful VVoman, Poets make ten; besides, Poets have not only made greater numbers of beautiful women, but perfecter beauties than ever Nature made.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Convers.</speaker>
                     <p>Then let me tell you, that women make Poets; for women kindle the masculine brains with the fire of Love, from whence arises a Poetical flame; and their Beauty is the fuel that feeds it.</p>

                  <sp>

                     <p>I confess, were there no women, there would be no Poets; for the Muses are of that Sex.</p>

serve to many several designs, or preaching, pleading, or speaking, the Theam or cause being altered; This is the difference betwixt extemporary Orato|ry, and premeditated Oratory, the one may be spoke, as many times as an O|rator will, and make the same Oratory serve to many several Subjects; the o|ther being not fixt, but voluntary, vanishes out of the remembrance, the same many times do my conceptions.</p>

                     <p>Why then I will tell you, I had a conception of a Monster, as a Creature that had a rational soul, yet was a Fool: It had had a beautiful and perfect shape, yet was deformed and ill-favoured; It had clear distinguish|ing senses, and yet was sencelesse; It was produced from the Gods, but had the nature of a Devil; It had an eternal life, yet dyed as a Beast, It had a body, and no body.</p>

                     <p>A man of Natures creating is as monstrous for though man hath a rational soul, yet most men are fools, making no use of their reason; and though Man hath a beautiful and perfect shape, yet for the most part, they make themselves deformed and ill-favoured with antick postures, violent passions, or brutish vices; and man hath clear distinguishing Senses, yet in his sleep, or with sumes, or drink, he is sencelesse: Man was produced immediately from the Gods, yet man being wicked, and prone to evil, hath by evil wick|ednesse the nature of a Devil; Man 'tis said, shall live for ever, as having an eternal life, yet betwixt this life and the other, he dyes like a Beast, and turns to dust as other Creatures do; but the only difference between the man Na|ture creates, and the man my Conceptions create is, that Natures man hath a real substance as a real body; whereas my conceptive man is only an Idea, which is an incorporal man, so as the body of my concepted man, is as the soul of Natures created man, an incorporality.</p>

                     <p>No, I admire them.</p>

                     <p>If you admire them, you will admire me, and if you admire me, you will yield to my desires.</p>

                     <p>Nature hath made Reason in man, as well as Sence, and we ought not to abuse the one, to please the other; otherwise man would be like Beasts, following their sensualities, which Nature never made man to be; for she created Virtues in the Soul, to govern the Senses and Appetites of the Body, as Prudence, Justice, Temperance, and Conscience.</p>

                     <speaker>Poor Vir.</speaker>
                     <p>No, it is the tenderest part of the Soul, bathed in a holy dew, from whence repentant tears do flow.</p>

                     <speaker>Effem. Love.</speaker>
                     <p>I find no such tender Constitution, nor moist Complexion in my Soul.</p>

                     <p>I wonder my Lord <hi>Courtship,</hi> he being counted a wise man; should make me his Baud, if he intends to make me his Wife, and by my troth Nurse, I am too young for that grave Office.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nurse Careful.</speaker>
                     <p>How ignorantly you speak Child? it is a sign you have been bred obscurely, and know little of the world; or rather it proves your Mother dyed before you could speak, or go, otherwise you would be better experien|ced in these businesses.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lady Ward.</speaker>
                     <p>My Mother, Nurse, Heaven rest her soul, she would never have made me a Baud.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nurse Careful.</speaker>
                     <p>No, why then she would not do as most Mothers do now a dayes; for in this age Mothers bring up their daughters to carry Letters, and to receive messages, or at lest to watch at the door left their Fathers should come unawares, and when they come to make some excuse, and then the Mother laughs, and sayes her daughter is a notable witty Girle.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>La. Ward.</speaker>
                     <p>What, for telling a lye?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nurse Careful.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, when it is told so, as to appeare like a truth.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lady Ward.</speaker>
                     <p>But it is a double fault, as to deceive the Father, and be a Baud to the Mother.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nurse Careful.</speaker>
                     <p>Why, the Mother will execute the same Office for the daugh|ter when she is marryed, and her self grown into years; for from the age of seven or eight years old, to the time they are maryed, the Daughter is a Baud to the Mother; and from the time of their marriage, to the time of their Mothers death, the Mother is a Baud to the Daughter; but if the Mother be indifferently young, and hath a young tooth in her head, as the old saying is, they Baud for each other.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lady Ward.</speaker>
                     <p>But why doth not the Mother Baud for her Daughter, before she is marryed.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nurse Care.</speaker>
                     <p>O there is reason for that, for that may spoil her fortune, by hindering her marriage: for marriage is a Veile to cover the wanton face of adultery, the like Veil is Baud-mothers, and Baud-daughters; for who would suspect any lewdnesse, when the Mother and the Daughter is toge|ther?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>La. Ward.</speaker>
                     <p>And are not Sons Pimps for their Fathers, as Daughters are for their Mothers?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nurse Careful.</speaker>
                     <p>No saith, Boys have facility, or ingenuity as Girles have; besides, they are kept most commonly so strictly to their Bookes, when Girles have nothing else to do; but when they have cast away their Books, and come to be marryed men, then they may chance to Pimp for their Wives.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lady Ward.</speaker>
                     <p>O fie Nurse, surely a man will never play the Pimp to Cuckold himself.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nurse Care.</speaker>
                     <p>O yes, if they be poor, or covetous, or ambitious; and then if they have a handsome woman to their wife, they will set her as a bait to catch their designs in the trap of Adultery; or patient, quiet, simple, fearful
<pb n="202" facs="113"/>
men will, if they have a Spritely wise, they will play the Pimp, either for fear, or quiet; for such men to such wives, will do any thing to please them, although it be to Cuckold themselves.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>La. Ward.</speaker>
                     <p>But surely Nurse no Gentleman will do so.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nurse Gare.</speaker>
                     <p>I know not who you call Gentleman, but those that bear up high and look big, and vant loud, and walk proud, and carry the out-side of a Gentleman, will do so.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>La. Ward.</speaker>
                     <p>Certainly Nurse they are but Bastard Gentry, or else they are degenerated.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nurse Careful.</speaker>
                     <p>An incipid Branch may spring from a sound Root, ma|ny a withered and rotten Plum may hang on a good Tree.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>La. Ward.</speaker>
                     <p>And do Wives play the Bauds for their Husbands, as the Hus|bands play the Pimps for their Wives?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nurse Care.</speaker>
                     <p>Most often; for they will make Gossiping meetings, on purpose for their Husbands to Court other women; for they know when their Hus|bands minds are fill'd with amorous love, they will not muse upon their acti|ons, nor examine their wayes; besides, when as the Husband would take his liberty without disturbance, he will wink at the liberty his wife takes, and so will be procures for each other, and the Ladys <hi>acquaintance</hi> are Confi|dents.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>La. Ward.</speaker>
                     <p>Confidents, what is that, Nurse?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Nurse Careful.</speaker>
                     <p>Why it is thus, two Ladies make friendship, or at least call Friends, and if any man desires to be a Courtly Servant to one of them, he addresses himself to the other, and expresses what Passions and Affections he hath for her friend, and so makes his complaints and affections known to her; whereupon she recommends his addresses and service to her Friend; thus doing a friendly Office by carrying and declaring his professions, and re|turning her Friends civil answers, appointing places for each others love-meetings, the other will do as much for her.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>La. Ward.</speaker>
                     <p>Why this is a Baud.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>

                     <p>O peace Child, for if any body heard you say so, they would laugh at you for a Fool, but 'tis a sign you never was a Courtier, for I knew a young Lady that went to Court to be a Maid of Honour; and there were two young Ladies that were Confidents to each other, and a great Prince made love to one of them, but adddrest himself to the other, as being her Friend; this young Maid askt why he did so, it was answered, she was the Princes Mistresse <hi>Confident</hi>; and just as you ask me, what said she, is a confi|dent a Baud; whereupon the whole Court laught at her, and for that only question condemned her to be a very Fool, nay, a meer Changling.</p>

                     <p>VVell Nurse, say what you will, Confident is but a Courtly name for a Baud.</p>

My love's beyond dissembling, so young, so fresh, so every thing, I warrant you; O Sir, you will ravish me, but yet you can|not.</p>

                     <p>I love Truth, Fidelity, Justice, Chastity; and I love obedience to lawful Authority, which rather than I would willingly and knowingly infring, I would suffer death.</p>

                     <p>But young Maid, you ought not to deny all gifts, for there are gifts of pure affection, Love-gifts of Charity, gifts of Humanity, and gifts of Generosity.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Poor Virtue.</speaker>
                     <p>They are due debts, and not gifts; For those you call gifts of pure Love, are payments to dear deserving friends; and those of Charity are payments to Heaven; and those of Humanity are payments to Nature, and those Generosity, are payments to Merit, but there are vain-glorious gifts, covetous gifts, gifts of fear, and gifts that serve as Bauds to corrupt foolish young Virgins.</p>

                     <p>Why, your thoughts speak in your mind, although your tongue keeps silence.</p>

                     <speaker>Contemp.</speaker>
                     <p>'Tis true; but they disturb not the mind with noise, for noise is the greatest enemy the mind hath: and as for my part, I think the most useless sense that Nature hath made, is hearing: the truth is, that hear|ing and smelling might well have been spared, for those two senses bring no materials into the brain; for sound and scent are incorporal.</p>

                     <speaker>Contemp.</speaker>
                     <p>There is no reason for that, for the eyes bring in pictures which serve the mind for patterns to draw new fancies by, and to cut, or carve out figurative thoughts, and the last serves towards the nourishment of the bo|dy, and touches the life.</p>

                     <speaker>Contemp.</speaker>
                     <p>Wisedome comes through the eye by experience; for we shall doubt of what we only hear, but never doubt of what we see perfectly: But the ground of wisedom is Reason, and Reason is born with the soul, where|fore the ear serves only for reproof, and reproof displeases the mind, and seldome doth the life any good; nay many times it makes it worse, for the mind being displeased, grows angry, and being angry, malicious, and being malicious, revengeful, and revenge is war, and war is destruction.</p>

                     <speaker>Contemp.</speaker>
                     <p>Harmony becomes discord by often repetition, and at the best it doth but rock the thoughts asleep; whereas the mind takes more plea|sure in the harmony of thoughts, and the musick of fancy, than in any that the senses can bring into it.</p>

                     <p>Pardon me, tongues were made for taste, not for words, for words wa an art which man invented: you may as well say, the hands were made to shuffle cards, or to do juggling tricks, when they were made to de|fend and assist the body; or you may as well say, the leg were made to cut capers, when they were made to carry the body, and to move, as to goe from place to place; for, though the hands can shuffle cards, or juggle, and the legs can cut capers, yet they were not made by Nature for that use, nor to that purpose; but howsoever, for the most part, the sense and reason of the mind is lost in the number of words; for there are millions of words for a single figure of sense, and many times a cyphre of nonsense stands instead of a figure of sense: Besides, there are more spirits spent, and flesh wasted with speaking, than is got or kept with eating, as witness Preachers, Pleaders, Players, and the like, who most commonly die with Consumptions; and I believe, many of our effeminate Sex do hurt the lungs with over-exercising of their tongues, not only with licking and tasting of Sweet-meats, but with chatting and prating, twitling and twatling; for I cannot say speaking, or discoursing, which are significant words, placed in a methodical order, then march in a regular body upon the ground of Reason, where sometimes the colour of Fancy is flying.</p>

                     <p>The world needs no increase, there are too many creatures al|ready, especially mankinde; for there are more than can live quietly in the world; for I perceive, the more populous, the more vicious.</p>

                     <p>Melancholy is the only hopes I do rely upon, that though I am poor, yet that may make me wise; for fools are most commonly mer|riest, because they understand not the follies that dwell therein, nor have e|nough considerations of the unhappiness of man, who hath endless desires, unprofitable travels, hard labours, restless hours, short pleasures, tedious pains, little delights, blasted joys, uncertain lives, and decreed deaths; and what is mirth good for? it cannot save a dying friend, nor help a ruined Kingdome, nor bring in plenty to a famished Land; nor quench out ma|lignant Plagues; nor is it a ward to keep misfortunes off, though it may tri|umph on them.</p>

produced therefrom. And as for Judgment and Wit, they are brother and sister; and although they do not alwayes, and at all times agree, yet are they alwayes the children of the Brain, being begot by Nature. Thus what Wit or Knowledge I have, may come immediatly from Nature, not from my Birth or Breeding; but howsoever, I am not what I seem.</p>

                     <p>Why thus; my Imagination (for Imagination can Create both Masculine and Feminine Lovers) had Created a Gentleman that was handsomer and more beautiful than <hi>Leander, Adonis,</hi> or <hi>Narcissus</hi>; vali|anter than <hi>Tamberlain, Scanderbeg, Hannibal, Caesar,</hi> or <hi>Alexander</hi>; sweeter-natur'd than <hi>Titus,</hi> the delight of mankinde; better-spoken, and more e|loquent than <hi>Tully,</hi> or <hi>Demosthenes</hi>; wittyer than <hi>Ovid,</hi> and a better Poet than <hi>Homer.</hi> This man to fall desperately in love with me, as loving my Vertues, honouring my Merits, admiring my Beauty, wondring at my Wit, doting on my Person, adoring me as an Angel, worshipping me as a God|dess; I was his Life, his Soul, his Heaven. This Lover courted my affe|ction: with all the industry of Life, gifts of Fortune, and actions of Ho|nour; sued for my favour, as if he had sued to Heaven for mercy; but I, as many cruel goddesses do, would neither receive his obligations, nor regard his vowes, nor pity his tears, nor hearken to his complaints, but rejected his Sute, and gave him an absolute denyal; whereupon he was resolved to dye, as believing no torments could be compared to those of my disdain; and since I would not love him living, he hoped by dying, his death might move my pity, and so beget a compassionate remembrance from me; wher|upon he got secretly neer my chamber-door, and hung himself just where I must go out, which when I saw, I starred back in a great fright, but at last running forth to call for help to cut him down, in came <hi>Monsieur Amorous,</hi> which hinderance made me leave him hanging there, as being ashamed to own my cruelty; and he hath been talking, or rather prating here so long, as by this time my kind Love is dead.</p>

                     <p>O no, for Lovers will hang a long time before they dye; for their necks are tuff, and their hearts are large and hot.</p>

                     <speaker>Contempl.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, pray leave me alone, that I may cut him down, and give him Cordials to restore life.</p>

                     <speaker>Visitant.</speaker>
                     <p>Faith you must let him hang a little time longer; for I have un|dertaken to make you a sociable Lady this day; wherefore you must goe a|broad to a friends house with me.</p>

                     <p>Who I? what do you think I will goe abroad, and leave my Lover in a twisted string? his legs hanging daugling down, his face all black and swelled, and his eyes almost started out of his head; no, no, pray goe alone by your self, and leave me to my <hi>Contemplation.</hi>

                     <p>Well, if you will not goe, I will never see you, nor be friends with you again.</p>

                     <speaker>Contempl.</speaker>
                     <p>That I cannot; for active bodies and active brains are never at once, the one disturbs the other.</p>

                     <speaker>Visitant.</speaker>
                     <p>Then it seems you had rather have an active brain, than an active body.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Contempl.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes; for when the brain doth work, the understanding is in|riched, and knowledge is gained thereby: whereas the body doth oft-times waste the life with too much exercise.</p>

                     <p>All distempers proceed from the body, and not from the minde; for the minde would be well, did not the humours and appetites of the body force it into a distemper.</p>

                     <speaker>Visitant.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, upon the condition you will goe, you shall sit still, and your wit shall be the Musick.</p>
