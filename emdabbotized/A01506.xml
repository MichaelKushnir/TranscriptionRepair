            <head>¶ To the right vvorshipfull Sir Owen Hopton Knight, the Queenes Maiesties Lieutenante of hir highnes Tower of London, <hi>Ber. Gar.</hi> Citizen of London wisheth health and increase of VVorship.</head>
            <p>_SIthens at my returne from Nor|wich (Right worshipfull) you vouchsa|fed to imparte vnto me your earnest de|sire to vnderstand the order and manner how hir Maiestie was receyued into that worthy Citie: I am bold likewise to de|cipher vnto your worship what occasion offered themselues to me vpon the same your request. First appeared to me the Maiestie of my Prince, which beautifieth her kingdome, as the bright shining beames of beautiful <hi>Phoebus</hi> decketh forth the earth: which gladded the hartes of the people there, as they no lesse laboured to trauayle forth to view the excellency of their soueraigne, than the true labouring Bee enforceth hir self in the Spring tyme (whē dame <hi>Flora</hi> first decketh the soile) to seeke their delights, and our pro|fit, amongst the sweete smelling floures. Then the aboundant clemencie of hir highnes, receyuing the loyall hartes of hir lo|uing people in parte, as good as their meaning deserued, so en|flamed their former desires, as euery sparke kindled a bonfire. The Nobilitie delighting this Harmony, so endeuoured to hold in tune euery string of this heauenly Musike, as there semed but one hart in Queene, Counsaile, and Communaltie. The Mayor, Magistrates, and good Citizens employed their study and sub|staunce


<pb facs="3"/>
to holde on this happy beginning, the Prince had hir pleasure, the Nobilitie their desire, the whole traine such inter|tainment: As for the tyme of hir continuance there, Norwich seemed (if any such there be) a terrestriall Paradise. But when the frowning Friday folowed, which called hir Maiestie thence, I leaue (because I am loth to tel) the dolour that was, to the re|port of them that did see it. These all, right Worshipfull, vpon your demaund, presented themselues vnto me to be vttred, and these (I thinke) are the thinges which you desired to heare. And because I doubt not but that there are a great number of your vertuous mynd herein: to satisfie both thē and you, I haue here set forth what my final capacitie could collect (touching the pre|misses) during the whole tyme of hir abode there. Accept my rude and rashe dealing in this my doyng, I beseech you, for that your Worshipfull request carieth me to my vttermost limite: wherein, though the sodaine chop of an vnskilfull Car●e●●●r perhaps disquareth the strong tymber of this beautifull 〈◊〉 yet let the skilfull eye of your worship and o|ther learned Readers (to whome I submitte me) place the same to the best purpose, and holde my good will as recompence of my fault, and bynde me to them, and you for euer. <hi>Vale.</hi>

            <head>¶ The receyuing of the Queenes Maiestie into hir highnesse Citie of Norvvich.</head>
            <p>_ON Saturday being the. xvj. of August. <hi>1578.</hi> and in the twentith yéere of the raigne of our most gratious soueraign Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> by the grace of God Quéen of England, Frāce, and Irelande, Defendor of the Faith. &amp;c. The same our moste dread and soueraigne Lady (con|tinuing hir Progresse in Norf|folke) immediately after dinner set forward from Brakenashe, where she had dyned with the Ladye Style, béeyng fiue myles distant from Norwich, towardes the same hir most dutifull Ci|tie: Sir <hi>Robert Wood,</hi> then Esquire, and nowe Knight, Maior of the same Citie, at one of the Clock the same happy day, sette forwarde to méete with hir Maiestie in this order: First there roade before him wel and séemly mounted, thréescore of the most comelie yong men of the Citie as Bachelers, apparelled all in blacke Sattyn doublets, blacke Hose, blacke Taffata Hattes and yeallowe Bandes, and their vniuersall liuerie was a Man|dylion of purple Taffata, layde about with siluer Lace: and so apparelled, marched forwardes two and two in a ranke. Then one which represented King <hi>GVRGVNT,</hi> sometime King of Englande, which builded the Castle of <hi>Norwich,</hi> called <hi>Blanch Floure,</hi> and layde the foundation of the Citie. He was mounted vppon a braue Courser, and was thus furnished: His body Ar|med:


<pb facs="4"/>
his Bases of gréen and white silke: on his head a black vel|uet Hat, with a plume of white Feathers. There attended vpon him thrée Henchmen in white and gréene: one of them did beare his Helmet, the seconde his Tergat, the third his Staffe. After him a noble companye of Gentlemen, and wealthie Citizens in veluet Coates, and other costly furniture, brauely mounted. Then followed the Officers of the Citie euery one in his place. Then Maister Sword bearer, with the Sworde and Hatte of Maintainaunce. Then Maister Maior, and foure and twentye Aldermen, and Maister Recorder, al in Scarlet gownes, wher|of, so many as had bin Maiors of the Citie, and were Iustices, did weare their scarlet cloakes. Then followed so many as had bin Sherifs, and were no Aldermen, in violet Gowns, &amp; satten tippets. Then followed diuers other, to kéepe the people from disturbing the array aforesaide. Ths euery thing in due and comely order, they al (except <hi>GVRGVNT</hi> which stayed hir ma|iesties cōming within a flight shot or two of the city, where the Castle of <hi>Blaunche Flowre</hi> was in moste beautifull prospect) marched forwardes to a bridge, called <hi>Hartforde Bridge,</hi> the vttermoste lymit that way, distaunt from the Citie two miles or thereaboutes, to méete with hir Maiestie: who, within one houre or little more after their attendaunce, came in such gra|tious and Princely wife, as rauished the harts of all hir louing subiects, and might haue terrifyed the stoutest heart of any eni|my to beholde. Whether the Maiestie of the Prince, whiche is incomparable, or ioy of hir subiectes, which excéeded measure, were the greater, I thinke woulde haue appalled the iudgement of <hi>Apollo</hi> to define. The acclamations and cries of the people to the Almighty God for the preseruation of hir Maiesty, ratled so loude, as hardly for a great time coulde any thing be hearde: But at laste, as euery thing hath an ende, the noise appeased: &amp; Maister Maior saluted hir highnesse with the Oration follo|wing, and yéelded to hir Maiestie there with the sworde of the Citie, and a faire standing cup of siluer and guilt, with a ●ouer, and in the Cup one hundreth pounds in golde. The Orati|on was in these wordes:</p>

                        <p>_THE Oratours (most gratious Queene) which liued in the age of them that won greatest renowme; were highly commended, for that they could transforme the Iudges mindes partly, by eloquence, and partly by setting downe before their eyes the calamitie of the thing and person they spake of, into what dispo|sition them listed: the first part declareth vnto vs no common facilitie of men, in that they were so willing in folowing, and attentiue in hea|ring, as they would suffer themselues to be lead by eloquence: the last, obteined great fauour amongest all nations, whose common weale was gouerned in good order, and far greater amongest the Christians: but greatest of all with thee O most excellent Queene, the nourse of Christ his church, whose minde obedient to Gods worde, the spirite of Christ, and zeale of Godlinesse, and not this profane kinde of speech hath instructed: the verie calamitie of Godly men, and teares of the afflicted, the teares, I say, of faithfull Christians haue throughly mo|ued thee to defende and protect the miserable and dispersed members of Christ obiecte to euerie kinde of iniurie, before beaten in peeces by


<pb facs="14"/>
a thousand deathes with the safetie and preseruation as well of minde as bodie: for these thy singuler benefits of Godlinesse towards vs, and that wee liue vnder so good a tutor beeing magistrate in this the Citie of Norwich, which thy maiestie hath of elemencie granted vnto vs for a mansion place, which were banished for Christ his religion, &amp; more|ouer that we finde the mindes of the people fauourable towards vs, first we geue immortall thanks, not suche as we ought, but such as we are able vnto God the father, and the Lorde our only sauiour Iesus Christ, and then vnto thee most mercifull Queene. Moreouer it is our hum|ble and yet our only petition to shewe vnto your maiestie the thank|fulnesse of our minde: behold therfore dedicated to your most excel|lent maiestie not any gifte but our minde, no princely iewell but a monument of godlinesse and posteritie, the which we hope will be so much the more acceptable to your maiestie, for because the goodnesse of God towardes your maiestie is liuely drawen out of the historie of the innocent &amp; most godly Iosephus, whom neither pollicie, strength nor desire of bearing rule, but constant faith, godlinesse of a Christian heart, and heauenly vertue by Gods singular mercie, deliuered from the bloudie conspiracie of his brethren &amp; feare of death, and brought vnto high dignitie and royal kingdome: to whose brethren that pro|uerbiall sentence of the Hebrewes is verie fitly alluded. Enuie being the desire of euill things, and couetousnesse of transitorie renowne, is often times the occasion of mans destruction: but touching the minde of Iosephus, the same was endued with suche temperance and forti|tude, that he might be thought no lesse vniust then wicked, that would accuse him so much as with the least affection of reuengement: so wholly did he commit him self and all the gouernement of his life, his life, I say, put in hazard in a strange kingdom vnto the proui|dence of God, that he seemed to hang of no other thing then the one|ly will of God. But to what ende speake I this? Are not these selfe same things, and others their like (ô most excellent Queene) by the eyes of all men cleerely beholden in thee, and the order of thy king|dome? What man (I say) hauing his wittes, can deny these thinges to be the most happie ioy, spirituall crowne, and cheefest ornament of Christes churche, and truely of this kingdome the princely beautie and perpetuall renowne? Thou surely doest followe moste hollily, the minde of Iosephus, by the singular goodnes of God, aswell in pre|seruing thy kingdome, as in amplifying the kingdome of Christe (ô thou most faithfull nourse of the churche of God:) for it is in God onely to destroy this man by prosperitie (as it seemeth vnto man) and aduaunce another by all kindes of aduersitie and humaine daunger: whome he acknowledgeth as the vessels of his mercie: and so by his goodnesse, together with the consolation and strength of his spirite, doth bring them to the happinesse of eternall life, which our petition

All the faith, studie, and obedience, which are due to so greate a Prince, as hitherto we haue most willingly imployed, so will we alwayes most diligently perfourme the same: and if at any time a|nie chaunce shall happen (which fortune God turne from vs) that the state of thy blessed maiestie or of this florishing realme shoulde come in daunger, or the worthinesse thereof be in hazarde, we doe not onely protest the effusion of all our goods and substaunce, but also the put|ting foorth and brunt of our strengthes and bodies therein. Finally we desire and beseech thy excellencie (most renowmed Queene) well to accepte of this our duetie, howe soeuer it be, pro|ceeding from a singular good will, and a moste thankfull minde, and so to think of vs Ci|tizens of Norwich, that perhaps you haue many times com to peo|ple more wealthie, but to more ioyfull neuer.</p>

            <p>_THose thinges which at their comming are ioyfull, when they depart are the more sorowful. For what (ô mighty God) could this Sunne at any tyme be|hold more happy, than we did seeme to our selues, either whē first (ô most merciful Prince) the bright|nesse of thy Maiestie did here shine out, or els in all the tyme we rested in your presence, as in a paradise or most happy abundance of all thinges. But woe to that chaungeable course of hu|maine thinges, which suffreth nothing vncorrupt, nor any thing eter|nall▪ so pleasure bringeth after it sadnesse, and griefe doth not onely sòdainly take away our delightes, but most bitterly cut of the same. So that we that lately receyued thee approching with all ioyes: should follow thee departing (if the renowne of your highnesse and trayne would suffer it) with mourning garments. If you demaund the cause of so great sorow, I know not what part of his Maiestie God hath in|dued your person withall, which doth stirre vp great reuerence of thee, but full of a certaine wonderfull loue, wherby it comes to passe that we hardely suffer our selues to be seuered from your presence. Adde moreouer, that we seeme after a sort vnto your highnesse (such is your clemencie) to haue satisfied euery pointe of gratefulnes: yet haue we not, nor euer shall we satisfie our selues in that behalfe. VVe would wishe a longer vse of tyme (if it were profitable) that we might expresse, if not a greater, yet a more continuall shew of our loue and obedience. But we must both yelde to your pleasure, and to the com|mon wealth, for that we know assuredly to our great and singular ad|u●uncement, you neuer cease to seeke out and afoord the same to all your subiectes. Go now therefore, go with luckie steppe thether, whe|ther thy vertue calleth thee. And for vs, this shall comfort vs aboun|dantly (which deserueth both immortall thankes and perpetuall me|mory) that thou so renowmed a Prince, hast vouchsafed so curteously to visite our dwellinges. And finally, we here before thee, whom God hath annointed, and before all this famous assembly, take God (which now beholdeth vs) to our witnesse, that we will keepe our faith and o|bedience in him to thee onely for euer. Thou Nurce of religion, Mo|ther of the Common VVealth, Beautie of Princes, Solace of thy Sub|iecte●, most happily (oh how I rue to speake it) Farewell.</p>

            <head>M^r Limberts Oration, vvhich had bin rehearsed at hir Graces departing, but that she set late forward in hir Progresse.</head>
            <p>_GEllius in his <hi>Noctibus Atticis</hi> (moste excellente Princesse) doth write, that it was the saying of <hi>Phae|uorinus</hi> the Philosopher, that the daye was one while a mother, another while a stepdame: and that hee vsed this verse, long time allowed, a|mong men, in hys accustomed communication, <seg xml:lang="unk">〈◊〉 〈◊〉〈◊〉</seg>. VVhich verse <hi>Gellius</hi> in this man|ner expoundeth: That of sorrows &amp; pleasures there be changes, that it cannot be well euery daye with vs, but this day well, and that day yl. And surely, that nothing hath bin at any time more gallauntly or truely spoken, both the continuall course of mans vncertaine estate, and the often alterations wherto he is subiect, manifestly declare, beside that, this present day giueth euident proofe thereof. For, the most ioyfull comming of your high|nesse, did not so muche recreate and comforte vs in our daylye desire and longing, as we are discouraged by this your depar|ting, whereto we see preparation made on al hands. And as all ages and degrees receyued your Maiestie, with ioy and gladnes at your comming: so there is not one but lamenteth and mour|neth at your graces going. And doubtlesse for my part, bycause myne owne hart is best knowne to my selfe, I protest that I ne|uer tooke vppon me a greater charge, then that, wherewyth at this present I am burthened: not onely to speake face to face with a most learned lady and princesse, which notwithstanding is, of it self, a harde and a busie matter: but, which is much more, that to me is befallē the sad and sorowful office of leaue taking. For, who woulde not be exceedingly greeued, to see the thing which he principallye desired, in a verye shorte time, and as it were <seg xml:lang="unk">〈◊〉 〈◊〉〈◊〉</seg>, at an instant taken away, before he might haue therof full fruition? How lamentable a thing is it, to pul away sucking babes from the breastes and bosomes of their most lo|uing


<pb facs="24"/>
mothers? That sonnes and fathers, through some miserable misfortune, shoulde be sundered? Yet I notwithstanding am of opinion, that nature hath not ingendered in any mā, such large loue, and so great good will, no not towarde them whom they haue begotten, or of whom they themselues haue bene begot|ten, as is the loue and good will wherewith we aduaunce, obey, and reuerence your Maiestie, being the mother and nurse of this whole Common welth, and Countrie. Great is the force of friendshippe and familiaritie, which oftentimes bringeth to passe, that they, which eyther by some kinde of fellowshippe, or by an accustomed condition of life, in tracte of time haue bin closely knitte, and so become both of one minde, and as it were growne togither, that hard and scant they may be seperated, &amp; set in sunder. Hereof sprang the faithfulnesse of <hi>Theseus,</hi> commē|ded by the mouth and monumentes of all men: and the entier friendshippe of innumerable more, whō no daungers, nor la|bours, eyther by sea or land, coulde sequester from their sweete society &amp; comfortable company, with whom they long had li|ued. And what desires, or what delightes haue any where bin founde, that may be compared with the sincere affection, and vnfayned good wil, which we beare to your Highnesse, moste excellent Princesse? These are not sufficiente shewes of our fayth and beneuolence, which is much greater, than that the e|loquence of any learned man, or that the slendernesse of my witte and capacitie maye make it manifest. Nature at no tyme tyed any thyng with a straighter knotte, or set seueral things at greater agreement, than the soule and the bodie: a declaration wherof is, the incredible consent and concorde of thē both, the mutual care and regard of succouring each other resting in thē both: and the grieuous departing, at the houre of death, the one frō the other remayning in them both. But we whiche professe Christian religion and godlynesse, haue learned this lesson, not only to loue our countrye, but also hir highnesse, in whom the health and safetie of our countrey consisteth, farre aboue the valiaunt <hi>Decij,</hi> the <hi>Scaeuolae</hi> the <hi>Curtij,</hi> which ventured their liues for the Common wealth of Rome: yea, to loue hir grace much


<pb facs="25"/>
better than our owne liues. For, what is he that woulde doubt to dye for hir sake, who if she were not, he should be constrey|ned to abide a bondage much more bitter than death? Neyther is this faithfull loue of vs your subiectes (most excellente Queene) lightly layde vp in our heartes, and scarcely couered as it were in the ground, but deepely rooted, so that by no stormes nor tempestes of Fortune it can be shaken, by no engines ouer|throwen, by no force or violence vndertroden. For how muche maketh it for the establishmente of faith and loue, in that we know your Maiestie hath obteyned regimente and rule, not at the pleasure and appoyntmente of wauering Fortune, but by right of inheritance, that is to say, <seg xml:lang="unk">〈◊〉 〈◊〉〈◊〉</seg>: nor that the Homericall Iuppiter <seg xml:lang="unk">〈◊〉 〈◊〉〈◊〉</seg>, but that the maker and Creator of all things delyuered it into your Highnesse handes? And therefore a singular neces|sitie of obedience is layde vpon vs, euen by God himselfe, least in Giant guise as it is feygned, we set shoulder against God, and being at defiance with him most wickedly, bidde him battell. When we beholde those excellent and diuine benefites, whiche youre grace hathe bestowed vpon the common wealthe, in so much that among manye, yea innumerable Countreys, and nations vnder the Sunne, none (I will not saye maye bee pre|ferred before vs) but not so much as one may be compared with vs. Ought not then a singulare loue and good will to be linc|ked with that lawe, and necessitie of obediēce? For what should I make rehearsall of full twenty yeares, wherein we haue liued in such peace and tranquilitie, as not only this our age hath ne|uer seene the like, but as in olde recordes and aunciente Chro|nicles of all ages and people, is no where mentioned? What shoulde I call to memorie hurlyburlies foreseene a farre off, as from an espyall: exceeding great daungers, not only perceyued by wisedome, but also preuented by counsell: secrete snares, and priuie practises disappoynted, not to muche by violence, as by policie: finally, all Treacherous attemptes, and Rebellious en|terprises, with great gladnesse and reioicing extinguished, with|out any tumult at all, or very little (doúbtlesse) insuing among


<pb facs="25"/>
the people? These things might make vs (although your Grace were otherwise than you are) performe all dutie of fayth and loue, with most willing mindes to your Maiestie. Nowe, for so muche as we haue your highnesse, our mercifull and bountifull Soueraigne, who possessing principalitie and royall regimente, doest not swarue an heares breadth from iustice and equitie, what is he for a man so sauage and obstinate, whome these so singulare and rare vertues may not allure to all loue and allegi|ance? Wherefore, if the surest safetie of Princes is the faith of their subiectes (as we haue heard very wise men holde opinion) what can be more safe, what can be more sure, than your excel|lencie, which the studies and endeauoures of your people, being so great, haue fenced and fortifyed? I haue made mine Oration the longer (most noble Queene) to the intent we might the lon|ger enioy your comfortable presence, from the whiche, to oure great griefe and sorow, we shall depart. But bycause lucke must be borne, which can not be auoyded, least I might seeme more than is meete to delay youre Graces progresse, whiles I am in hand to please mine owne humour, I will make an ende. Con|cerning your Maiestie, whose presence this day will shutte from our sight, we will notwithstanding in your absence behold and reuerence, we will loue youre Highnesse with all oure heartes, mindes, and endeauoures: we will most dutyfully obey youre Graces Lawes and Commaundementes. Finally, your Maie|sties good estate (wherevpon likewise our safetie depen|deth) we will commende to Almightie God in oure dayly Prayers, that the same a long tyme may bee continued, and also pre|serued. Amen.</p>

            <head>¶ Ad Ciuitatem Norwicensem de Aduentu Serenissimae Reginae ELIZABETHAE.</head>
            <l>ERgo tibi antiquae laudes, &amp; auita resurget</l>
            <l>Gloria Norwice, &amp; veteris spe● reddita famae est:</l>
            <l>Nam{que} tuos Regina lares faelicibus intrat</l>
            <l>Auspicijs, clarum{que} tuae Iubar intulit vrbi.</l>
            <l>Magnum numen habes, quo nil augustius vsquam</l>
            <l>Sol videt, aut ingens maius complectitur orbis.</l>
            <l>Illa suis magnum verae pietatis amorem.</l>
            <l>Restituit, sanctam{que} fidem sine fraude dolosa</l>
            <l>Reddidit aeternis è fontibus: illa tumentem</l>
            <l>Aequantem{que} Deo semet Regum{que} Tyrannum</l>
            <l>Fregit, &amp; Inferno damnatum carcere mersit.</l>
            <l>Perge pijs Animis dignas{que} euoluito grates,</l>
            <l>Aduentum{que} sacrum Diuinae Principis altis</l>
            <l>●udibus illustra, voces{que} in sidera mitte.</l>
            <l>Nempe facis: video motus vultus{que} tuorum</l>
            <l>Feruores{que} auidos, plausus{que} &amp; anhela flagrantum</l>
            <l>Pectora, sinceras{que} praeces, at{que} vndi{que} vulgi</l>
            <l>Laetitiam ingentem: ne{que} enim haec sacra frequentant</l>
            <l>Soli primates vrbis, lectus{que} Senatus,</l>
            <l>Quin etiam populus, pueri, innuptae{que} puellae</l>
            <l>Exultant Animis: adeo vox omnibus vna est</l>
            <l>Aduentasse decus Reg●i, at{que} hac vrbe coruscum</l>
            <l>Illuxisse Iubar, magnam{que} in secula famam</l>
            <l>Norwico partam, nullus quam carpere liuor</l>
            <l>Aut violare potest, nostris non eximet aetas</l>
            <l>Mentibus, aut nigra condet sub nube vetustas.</l>
            <l>Macte animis, n●tat ista deus, meritum{que} laborem</l>
            <l>Laudat, &amp; obsequijs vestris studio{que} fideli</l>
            <l>Attribuet longos, optatae Principis Annos.</l>
