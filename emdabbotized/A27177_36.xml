                           <l>My happineſs is in mine own content,</l>

                           <l>And let me tell thee, there was no ſuch matter:</l>
                           <l>Nothing intended that way of that nature;</l>
                           <l>I have more to do with my honeſty than to fool it,</l>
                           <l>Or venture it in ſuch leak-barks as women;</l>
                           <l>I put 'em off; becauſe I lov'd 'em not,</l>

                           <l>And not for thy ſake, nor the Contract ſake,</l>
                           <l>Nor vows, nor oathes; I have made a thouſand of 'em,</l>
                           <l>They are things indifferent, whether kept or broken;</l>

                           <l>For, as I think, there was never man yet hop'd for</l>
