                  <p>_I Vnderstand you, Gentlemen, no● your houses: and a worthy suc|cession of you, to all time, as be|ing borne the Iudges of these studies. When I wrote this <hi>Poeme,</hi> I had friendship with diuers in your societies; who, as they were great Names in learning, so they were no lesse Examples of liuing. Of them, and then (that I say no more) it was not despis'd. Now that the Printer, by a doubled charge, thinkes it worthy a lon|ger life, then commonly the ayre of such things doth promise; I am carefull to put it a seruant to their plea|sures, who are the inheriters of the first fauour borne it. Yet, I command, it lye not in the way of your more noble, and vse-full studies to the publike. For so I shall suffer for it: But, when the gowne and cap is off, and the Lord of liberty raignes; then, to take it in your hands, perhaps may make some Bencher, tincted with humanity, reade: and not repent him.</p>

He vsurps vpon cheats, quarrels, and robberies, which he neuer did, only to get him a name. His chiefe exercises are, taking the Whiffe, squiring a Cocka|trice, and making priuy searches for Imparters.</p>

                     <l>A kind of dew; and hence we doe conclude,</l>

                     <l>As wanting power to containe it selfe,</l>

                        <p>Right, for what a man truly enuies in another, he could al|waies loue, and cherish in himselfe: but no man truly reprehends in ano|ther, what he loues in himselfe; therefore reprehension is out of his hate. And this distinction hath he himselfe made in a speech there (if you markt it) where he saies, <hi>I enuie not this</hi> BVFFON, <hi>but I hate him.</hi>

                        <p>No more, assure you, will any graue, wise citizen, or modest matron, take the obiect of this folly in DELIRO, and his wife: but rather apply it as the foile to their owne vertues. For that were to affirme, that a man, writing of NERO, should meane all Emperors: or speaking of MA|CHIAVEL, comprehend all States-men; or in our SORDIDO, all Farmars; and so of the rest: then which, nothing can be vtter'd more malicious, or absurd. Indeed, there are a sort of these narrow-ey'd decypherers, I con|fesse, that will extort strange, and abstruse meanings out of any subiect, be it neuer so conspicuous and innocently deliuer'd. But to such (where e're they sit conceal'd) let them know, the author defies them, and their wri|ting-tables; and hopes, no sound or safe iudgement will infect it selfe with their contagious comments, who (indeed) come here only to peruert, and poison the sense of what they heare, and for nought else.</p>

How's this? <hi>Yours, if his owne?</hi> is he not my sonne, except he be his owne sonne? Belike this is some new kinde of subscription the gallants vse. Wel, wherefore doest thou stay, knaue? Away: goe. Here's a letter indeede; ie●els? and beneuolence? is this a weather to send beneuolence? or is this a season to reuell in? Slid the deuil and all takes part to vexe me, I thinke! this letter would neuer haue come now else, now, now, when the sunne shines, and the aire thus cleere. Soule, if this hold, we shall shortly haue an excellent crop of corne spring out of the high waies: the streets, and houses of the towne will be hid with the ranknesse of the fruits, that grow therein spight of good husbandry. Goe to, I'le preuent the ●ight of it, come as quickly as it can, I will preuent the sight of it. I haue this reme|die, heauen. Stay; I'le trie the paine thus a little, Ô, nothing, nothing. Well now, shall my sonne gaine a beneuolence by my death? or any body be the better for my gold, or so forth? No, aliue, I kept it from 'hem, and (dead) my ghost shall walke about it, and preserue it, my son and daugh|ter shall starue ere they touch it, I haue bid it as deep as hell from the sight of heauen, and to it I goe now.<note place="marg" anchored="true">

I must bee the first head of our house, and yet he will not giue me the head till I bee made so. Is any man term'd a gentleman that is not alwayes i'the fashion? I would know but that.</p>

Pish, the title of a friend, it's a vaine idle thing, only venerable among fooles: you shall not haue one that has any opinion of wit affect it.</p>

                        <p>Your wife? now for shame lose these thoughts, and become the master of your owne spirits.

                        <p>Such a wife? Now hate mee, sir, if euer I discern'd any wonder in your wife, yet, with all the speculation I haue: I haue seene some that ha' beene thought fairer then she, in my time; and I haue seene those, ha' not been altogether so tall, esteem'd properer women; and I haue seen lesse noses grow vpon sweeter faces, that haue done verie well too, in my iudge|ment: but in good faith, signior, for all this, the gentlewoman is a good pretie proud hard-fauour'd thing, mary not so peerelessely to bee doted vpon, I must confesse: nay, be not angrie.</p>

<pb n="144" facs="84"/>
and, by my life, I suspect her honestie, that's more, which you may likewise suspect (if you please:) doe you see? Ile vrge you to nothing, a|gainst your appetite, but if you please, you may suspect it.</p>

Now indeed, sir, (I must tell you) he did offer at first very desperately, but with|out iudgement: for looke you, sir. I cast my selfe into this figure: now he, comes violently on, and withall aduancing his rapier to strike, I thought to haue tooke his arme (for he had left his whole body to my election, and I was sure he could not recouer his guard) Sir, I mist my purpose in his arme, rasht his doublet sleeue, ran him close by the left cheek, and through his haire. He againe, lights me here (I had on, a gold cable hatband, then new come vp, which I wore about a murrey <hi>French</hi> hat I had) cuts my hatband (and yet it was massie, gold-smithes worke) cuts my brimmes, which by good fortune (being thicke embrodered with gold-twist, and spangles) disappointed the force of the blow: Neuerthelesse, it graz'd on my shoulder, takes me away sixe purles of an <hi>Italian</hi> cut-worke band I wore (cost me three pound in the exchange, but three daies before.)</p>

Now (vpon the second signe of his assault) I betooke me to the former manner of my defence; he (on the other side) abandon'd his bo|dy to the same danger, as before, and followes me still with blowes: But I (being loth to take the deadly aduantage that lay before mee of his left side) made a kind of <hi>stramazoun,</hi> ranne him vp to the hilts, through the

doublet, through the shirt, and yet mist the skin. Hee (making a reuerse blow) falls vpon my emboss'd girdle (I had throwne off the hangers a lit|tle before) strikes off a skirt of a thick—lac't sattin doublet I had (lin'd with some foure taffataes) cuts off two panes, embrodered with pearle, rends through the drawings out of tissew, enters the linings, and skips the flesh.</p>

                        <p>O, hee's a fellow of a strange nature. Now do's hee (in this calme of his humour) plot, and store vp a world of malicious thoughts in his braine, till hee is so full with 'hem, that you shall see the very torrent of his enuie breake forth like a land-floud: and, against the course of all their affections oppose it selfe so violently, that you will almost haue won|der to thinke, how 'tis possible the current of their dispositions shall re|ceiue so quick, and strong an alteration.</p>

How tedious a sight were it to behold a proud exalted tree lopt, and cut downe by degrees, when it might bee feld in a moment? and to set the axe to it before it came to that pride, and fulnesse, were, as not to haue it grow.</p>

And yet mee thinkes you should take your leaue of <hi>Enfans-perdus</hi> here, your forlorne hope.

                        <p>What, doe you sigh? this it is to kisse the hand of a countesse, to haue her coach sent for you, to hang poinards in ladies garters, to weare bracelets of their haire, and for euery one of these great fauours to giue some slight iewell of fiue hundred crownes, or so, why 'tis nothing. Now, Monsieur, you see the plague that treads o' the heeles of your fopperie: well, goe your waies in, remoue your selfe to the two-penny ward quick|ly, to saue charges, and there set vp your rest to spend sir PVNTARS hun|dred pound for him. Away, good pomander, goe.</p>
                        <l>Why, here's a change! Now is my soule at peace.</l>
                        <l>I am as emptie of all enuie now,</l>

Wel, gentlemen, I should haue gone in, and re|turn'd to you, as I was ASPER at the first: but (by reason the shift would haue beene somewhat long, and we are loth to draw your patience far|der) wee'le intreat you to imagine it. And now (that you may see I will be out of humour for companie) I stand wholly to your kind approba|tion, and (indeed) am nothing so peremptorie as I was in the beginning: Mary, I will not doe as PLAVTVS, in his <hi>Amphytrio,</hi> for all this <hi>(Summi Ionis causa, Plaudite:)</hi> begge a <hi>Plaudite,</hi> for gods sake; but if you (out of the bountie of your good liking) will bestow it; why, you may (in time) make leane MACILENTE as fat, as Sir IOHN FAL-STAFFE.</p>

                  <l>NEuer till now did obiect greet mine eyes</l>
                  <l>With any light content: but in her graces,</l>
                  <l>All my malicious powers haue lost their stings.</l>
                  <l>Enuie is fled my soule, at sight of her,</l>
                  <l>And shee hath chac'd all black thoughts from my bosome,</l>
                  <l>Like as the sunne doth darkenesse from the world.</l>
                  <l>My streame of humour is runne out of me.</l>
                  <l>And as our cities torrent (bent t'infect</l>

                  <l>Is checkt by strength, and clearnesse of the riuer,</l>
                  <l>Till it hath spent it selfe e'ene at the shore;</l>
                  <l>So, in the ample, and vnmeasur'd floud</l>
                  <l>Of her perfections, are my passions drown'd:</l>
                  <l>And I haue now a spirit as sweet, and cleere,</l>
                  <l>As the most rarefi'd and subtile aire.</l>
                  <l>With which, and with a heart as pure as fire,</l>
                  <l>(Yet humble as the earth) doe I implore,</l>
                  <l>O heauen, that shee (whose presence hath effected</l>
                  <l>This change in me) may suffer most late change</l>
                  <l>In her admir'd and happie gouernement:</l>
                  <l>May still this <hi>Land</hi> be call'd <hi>fortunate,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And rugged treason tremble at the sound</l>

                  <l>When he but lookes vpon her blessed soile.</l>
                  <l>The throat of warre be stopt within her land,</l>
                  <l>And turtle-footed peace dance <hi>fayrie</hi> rings</l>
                  <l>About her court: where, neuer may there come</l>
                  <l>Suspect, or danger, but all trust, and safetie:</l>
                  <l>Let flatterie be dumbe, and enuie blind</l>
                  <l>In her dread presence: death himselfe admire her:</l>
                  <l>And may her vertues make him to forget</l>
                  <l>The vse of his ineuitable hand.</l>
                  <l>Flie from her age; Sleepe time before her throne,</l>
                  <l>Our strongest wall falls downe, when shee is gone.</l>
