                        <p>Retyre, you houshold-gods, and leaue these excellent creatures to be entertayned by a more eminent deitie. Hayle King, and Queene of the Islands, call'd truely fortunate, and by you made so; To tell you, who I am, and weare all these notable, and speaking ensignes about me, were to challenge you of most impossible ignorance, and accuse my selfe of as palpable glorie: It is inough that you know me here, and come with the licence of my father IOVE, who is the bountie of heauen, to giue you early welcome to the bower of my mother MAIA, no lesse the goodnesse of earth. And may it please you to walke, I will tell you no wonderfull storie. This place, whereon you are now aduanced (by the mightie power of <hi>Poetrie,</hi> and the helpe of a faith, that can remoue mountaynes) is the <hi>Arcadian</hi> hill CYLLENE, the place, where my selfe was both begot, and borne; and of which I am frequently call'd CYLLENIVS: Vnder yond' purslane tree stood sometime my cradle. Where, now, behold my mo|ther MAIA, sitting in the pride of her plentie, gladding the aire with her breath, and cheering the spring with her smiles. At her feet, the blushing AVRORA, who, with her rosie hand, casteth her honie dewes on those sweeter herbs, accompanied with that gentle winde, FAVONIVS, whose subtile spirit, in the breathing forth, FLORA makes into flowers, and sticks them in the grasse, as if shee contended to haue the imbroyderie of the

earth, richer then the cope of the skie. Here, for her moneth, the yeere|ly delicate <hi>May</hi> keepes state; and from this <hi>Mount,</hi> takes pleasure to dis|play these valleyes, yon'd lesser hills, those statelier edifices, and towers, that seeme enamour'd so farre off, and are rear'd on end, to behold her, as if their vtmost obiect were her beauties. Hither the <hi>Dryads</hi> of the valley, and <hi>Nymphs</hi> of the great riuer come euery morning, to taste of her fauors; and depart away with laps fill'd with her bounties. But, see! vpon your approch their pleasures are instantly remitted. The birds are hush'd, ZE|PHYRE is still, the MORNE forbeares her office, FLORA is dumbe, and herselfe amazed, to behold two such maruailes, that doe more adorne place, then shee can time; Pardon, your Maiestie, the fault, for it is that hath caus'd it; and till they can collect their spirits, thinke silence, and wonder the best adoration.</p>

                        <p>Againe, great payre, I salute you; and with leaue of all the gods: whose high pleasure it is, that MERCVRY make this your holy-day. May all the blessings both of earth, and heauen, concurre to thanke you: For till this dayes sunne, I haue faintly inioy'd a minutes rest to my crea|tion. Now, I do, and acknowledge it you sole, and no lesse the diuine bene|fit. If my desire to delight you, might not diuert to your trouble, I would intreat your eyes to a new, and strange spectacle; a certaine sonne of mine, whom the <hi>Arcadians</hi> call a god, howsoeuer the rest of the world receiue him: It is the horned PAN, whom in the translated figure of a goate I be|got on the faire <hi>Spartan</hi> PENELOPE; MAY, let both your eares, and lookes forgiue it: These are but the lightest escapes of our Deities. And, it is better in me, to preuent his rusticke impudence, by my blushing ac|knowledgement, then, anon, by his rude, and not insolent clayme, be en|forced to confesse him. Yonder hee keepes, and with him the wood <hi>Nymphes,</hi> whose leader he is in rounds, and daunces, to this <hi>Syluane</hi> mu|sique. The place, about which they skip, is the fount of laughter, or BACCHVS spring; whose statue is aduanced on the top; and from whose pipes, at an obseru'd howre of the day, there flowes a lustie liquor, that hath the present vertue to expell sadnesse; and within certaine minutes after it is tasted, force all the myrth of the spleene into the face. Of this is PAN the Guardian. Loe! the fountain begins to run, but the Nymphes at your sight are fled. PAN, and his <hi>Satyres</hi> wildly stand at gaze. I will approach, and question him: vouchsafe your eare, and forgiue his beha|uiour, which (euen to me, that am his parent) will no doubt be rude ynough, though otherwise full of salt, which, except my presence did temper, might turne to be gall, and bitternesse; but that shall charme him.</p>
