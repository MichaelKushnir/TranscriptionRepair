               <p>_MEGAERA ONE OF THE
Helliſh furies raiſing vp Tantalus frō
Hell, incited him to ſet mortall hatred
betwene his two nephewes Thieſtes, &amp;
Atreus being brothers, and raining as Kinges ouer
Mycenae by enterchangeable turnes, that is to witte
Thieſtes to raine the one yere, and Atreus the other.
Now Atreus enraged with furie againſt his brother
partly for defiling and deflouring his wife Aerope by
pollicie, and partly for taking from him a Ram with
a golden fleeſe, practiſed with his ſeruāt how to be re|uēged
of his brother. This Atreus therfore diſſēblīg
a reconciliation &amp; inuiting Thyestes to Mycenae ſe|cretly
&amp; vnknowē to him, ſet before hī at a banquet
the fleſh of his own childrē to eate. Afterward Atreus
hauīg alſo geuē to his ſaid brother y^e bloud of his chil|drē
in a goblet to drinke, did laſtly cōmaūd the heads
alſo to be brought in, at the doleful ſight wherof Thi|eſtes
greatly lamēting knowīg y^e he had eatē his owne
childrē, was wonderfully anguiſhed. But Atreus for
that he had thus reuenged himſelfe, toke therin great
pleaſure and delectation.</p>
