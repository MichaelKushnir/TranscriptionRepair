                  <p>Know my <hi>Euthimius,</hi> that this day the Iudges must undergoe Judgement, those Conscript Fathers whose purple we once adored are now sicke of a <hi>Iudici|all Feaver,</hi> by reason of their corrupt sentence given; to the greivance of the Subiect, and favour of their Prince.</p>

they escape the Gallowes, if they give not very good satisfaction to that Honorable and grave assembly nor will they easily so doe: For it is generally said that they were the very fountaine of all the teares and tumults of this languishing Island.</p>

                  <speaker>Euthym.</speaker>
                  <p>Let them all dye, if they have abused the seate of Judgement; it is much better that <hi>one</hi> perish then an <hi>vnity</hi>: a luxurious branch, then a fruitfull vine, some kinde of mercy is cruelty; by whose remisnesse or burthen rather, every diseased common-wealth is af|flicted: This have I alwaies said, and this renowned Island hath found it too true by experience: to spare the evill, is an endammagement to the good. But what are these?</p>

                  <p>If I should directly expresse their conditions, I should shew you diverse gestures arising from the selfe same affection. They are two Phylosophers that ieere and weepe at the passages of the World. He, <hi>Heraclitus</hi> plaies the part of a compassionate man, hee is 〈◊〉 with teares, and no sooner sees then sighes at the vani|ties of men; But the other, <hi>Democritus</hi> derides the age; and scoffeth mens generall folly; setting up this Motto over his doore.</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>Miserum me video, &amp; rideo;</l>

                  </lg>
                  <p>I see my owne miserie and laugh at it; I see thy mise|ry and envie it not. But many there are who doe out|wardly reioyce, but inwardly sigh: they laugh and caroll with their mouthes, but lament and condole with their hearts. This may you soone perceive by their enter|change of discourse.</p>

                  <p>Because thou weepest; for what canst thou finde in this 〈◊〉 Theater of the world, which is worthy thy smallest teare? where servants are made Lords, Lords servants; the Masters head is cut off, the servant riseth up, and 〈…〉 into his place wives bewaile the funerall of their 〈…〉 teares and offering leape into their graves; and yet before one worme hath entred into the winding 〈◊〉 or before the flowers are withered wherewith the course was garnished, they entertaine new affecti|ons and 〈…〉</p>

                  <p>What besides dost thou aske? Get thee 〈…〉, and thou shal every where finde the spectacles of derision. This man is honored in the sight of his Prince; enioyeth his delights, stretcheth upon beds of yvory, and is 〈◊〉 with honours, as with burthen; he seekes nothing, but he acquires it, he 〈…〉, but he obtaines it; all men that sees his estate admires him, and esteemes him the happi|est man upon the earth: in the meane while one small cloud obsoureth all these false beames in a day, ye in a minute of an houre, his Prime leaveth him, his glo|ry departeth like a dreame; and his <hi>Atlas</hi> who carri|ed such heapes, such mountaines of honour upon his shoulders, hath his <hi>exit</hi> with reproach; hah, hah, hah. Yet no sooner hath this <hi>Hero</hi> suffered an inrevo|cable fate; but he is wisht alive againe by them, who in his life and glory prosecuted him with extremest violence: They hate him alive; lament his dead, and with pious teares desire his restriction: but great 〈◊〉 heads are sooner taken off, then set on againe. In these times it is is more security to be a foote then

a wise man; for a wise mans head is a subiect for the axe, the foole keepes his upon his shoulders▪ will you heare more?</p>

Thou shalt find althings saleable in <hi>Troinovant</hi>; the dainty dames will untie thy purse strings with a busse: out goes the husband, in comes the friend; hah, hah, hah. Thou shalt finde some that resigne their offices least they should loose them; others leaving their nest, that thy and their young may not perish, others that abounded through rapine miserably exhausted; others adorned with others feathers, that have cast their owne. Here thou shalt see Coblers and huck|sters that rise out of old shooes and panniers, bea|ting the Pulpit, and broaching new doctrines, as if they were <hi>Regij Professores,</hi> and held by the rable to be most profound Divinity: yea, I cannot wash my hands but me thinkes I see the soapy <hi>effigies</hi> of <hi>Brun|field</hi> in the Bason▪ nor can I goe downe into a celler, but I finde the lively statue of Master <hi>Abell</hi>; yea I can|not, untie my shooe, but I call to minde that patent for Leather and deride it; For men now truely seeme turned into trees bringing forth spatious branches, but fruits of vanity: in a word all the world is full of fooles, and ridiculous in the eyes of <hi>Democritus.</hi>

                  <p>And iustly, my <hi>Heraclitus</hi>; for who if hee were wise would not forsake an house of clay to come unto an heavenly dominion▪ But these mad men place their <hi>Elysium</hi> upon earth, little regarding the future that they may enioy the present. They demo|lish, build up, they provide cloathes for moths and edifices for the wind. They no sooner perceive the hooke of honour, then they greedily swallow it; that stickes in their throates, and they are worthily taken▪ Nor doe these things rage onely in greener mindes; for although (as saies that <hi>Sicilian</hi>) <hi>It is a pro|digy</hi> for a young man to be old, ridiculous for an old man to be young; yet you may see the hoary Elders of this land, that have a foot in the grave, and by their age should have wisedome, or at the least autho|rity &amp; reverence, plunged into most haynous crimes; so that it may truely be said of them, they grow as old in vices as in yeares.</p>

                  <p>How many excellent guifts hath nature be|stowed on him; which if they had beene seasoned with humility and grace, they had made him com|pleatly famous. But to proud men no burthen is more dangerous then honour: they so easily change their conditions, that they wil not know their friends and acquaintance. These tumours of the world prick on their mindes with such a strange kind of fury, that they make themselves hated by their familiers and o|thers: wherefore an office is best aquired by a Ma|gistrate; nor is it better bestowed on any then on him who seekes it not at all, or very coldly. This he well advised who said: let it bee given to him that denies it, and denyed to him that excepts it. But long let this <hi>Chrysomitris</hi> nest in a forreigne nation before hee be recalled. We have enough of such saluters alrea|dy: wee have too tenderly cherished such ominous birds; let them leave our coasts and returne no more least they destroy the mother that nourished them. But that wee may comprise all in one, and never did any man shew himselfe more ingratefull then this</p>

he imputed his crimes unto his Prince; whereas a constant and resolute minde would sooner endured a thousand deaths, yea (like that heroicke spirit that lately suffered) would with a chearefull looke retort the threats of inexorable fate, then cast the least aspersion upon a Prince so well deser|ving. But let him passe with his eloquence, then whom never was Judge more uniust, never a Lord keeper more corrupt nor more poore, no Soli|citer more impure and more importunate: In the meane while lest wee bee reckoned in their number who have eloquent tongues, but corrupt hearts, let us discourse of every thing propounded unto us not so curiously as faithfully and discreetly, not so ex|actly as iustly and rightfully.</p>

This I will confidently averre, that no man hath de|served worse, of the Common-weale: when all men esteemed him the maine defendor of Iustice, he ex|pressed himselfe her most vowed enimy, to the re|proach of his name, and corruption of his conscience. Hee saw and fell with open eyes: he knew the right and did the wrong; and therfore his ruine is deser|ved. For if he had beene ignorant of the lawes, as <hi>Trivius,</hi> he might have had some colour of excuse, but to give sentence against the most certaine rule, of his owne knowledge, O prodigie!</p>

                  <p>I ingeniously confesse, and no lesse desire best of favour, that partly by the threats, partly by the flatteries of Chrisomitris, I gave that unheard of sentence of ship-money. For <hi>Chrysomitris,</hi> who as you know had a most fortunate art in the way of perswati|on, told mee that unlesse I gave that judgement for the King, I should loose mine honour: and suffer a <hi>writ of Ease</hi> to my extreme disgrace.</p>

Should you pre|ferre <hi>Writs of ease</hi> before ease of Conscience? should you bee the more prone, unto the earth, by how much you are neerer to your ends? to have one foot in the grave, and a mind coveting the world? O if you would consider how litle would suffice nature, &amp; of that lit|tle, how small a portion would content old age, your care for earthly things would be abated, and your de|sires would be wholy fixed upon heaven, for you who were so eminent in the studies of the Law, are most severely to bee punished, especially having so cleare,
<pb facs="13"/>
so excellent a mirrour as <hi>Curvus Acilius,</hi> a man of extreme age, but a vigourous minde, an inviolate conscience. Him you had for an example; but (although your steps were <hi>Curva vestigia</hi>) refusing to follow <hi>Curvus,</hi> you have turned the right into oblique, you know you well knew (to the aggravation of your censure, those golden sentences of Periander, most worthy your memory, that <hi>nothing must be done for moneys sake,</hi> and that <hi>favour is an enemy to Iudge|ment.</hi> For Iudgement faileth where it becomes matter of affection. Too much love and too much hatred pervert the truth. Nor did <hi>Ioachimus</hi> lately deceased deserve any lesse; but by paying his debt to nature, the destinies have made him their perpetuall debtor. For though hee were intricall and knotty in his arguments, yet this <hi>Oedipus</hi> with his riddles, the Fates had not prevented, had in|volved himselfe in a Gregorian knot.</p>

In which, I say, how wretchedly have you erred? For you were Iudges, &amp; censurers of the selfe same crime, whereof you were the Authors. For a Iudge to take a bribe, was a capitall thing; But if so great &amp; so heavy a sentence was pronouced for one fault, &amp; that extending but to a particular subiect, what punishment must be inflicted on them, who have beene so iniurous to the subiects, of a whole flourishing Iland; by making the Prince suspicious of his subiects: the Subiects of their Prince; by declaring new opinions against the evident te|stimonys of their consciences; by perturbing the Halcyon days of a peacefull king, &amp; an obedient state; yea by bring|ing all according to their power, into flames and ashes; If such a fire whereof you were the true Incendiarys, do not deserve death, what it better deserveth I cannot tell. The law was first ordained to be a publike benefit; but by you it

                  <p>Observe &amp; heare what I shall say: I beleeve that in leasure houres, you have read how the Germanes having been rather conquered then subiect by their good leading of <hi>Drusus,</hi> assoone as hee was dead, trusting upon their strength began to hate the lust &amp; insolence of <hi>varus Quin|ctilius,</hi> and how easily they became victors. Which short conflict being ended, like <hi>Barbarians</hi> as they were, they shewed themselves most savage, &amp; tirranous conquerours: Nor in that extreame cruelty, did they shew themselves more implacable towards any condition, then to men of the cōsulare dignity, thinking that through their eloquent &amp; vendible tongues, the <hi>Romanes</hi> had first beleagued them, &amp; brought thē to that calamity. <hi>Varus</hi> prosecuts them with the same mind &amp; fate of <hi>Paulus</hi> at <hi>Cannae,</hi> never was greater slaughter in fields &amp; woods, never more intolerable insulta|tiō,
<pb facs="16"/>
but especially towards those that pleaded causes. Some of their eyes pulled out, others hands cut off, one's mouth they sewed up, first cutting out his tongue, which a Bar|barian holding in his hand said, at length; <hi>viper desist from hissing,</hi> you should likewise call to mind <hi>Manius Acilius</hi>; that unsatisfied gulfe of briberie, &amp; principall Embassadour of the <hi>Romans,</hi> whom <hi>Mithridates</hi> with great cōtempt, com|pelled to ride upon an asse, untill he came unto <hi>Pergamus,</hi> where he commanded <hi>Elixar</hi> of gold to be thrust into his mouth, intimating that the <hi>Romans</hi> were to much given to briberys, &amp; had tongues, too eloquent in evil speaking. <hi>Alex||ander Severus</hi> the greatest enemy of flatterers, commanded that <hi>Turinus</hi> one of his courtiers; should bee tyed to a stake in the market place, and smother'd to death with smoke, having a cryer proclaiming by him. <hi>Let him perish with smoke, that sold smoke</hi>: For it is better (to use <hi>Antisthenes</hi> words) to fall amongst crowes, then <hi>Parasites</hi>; a|mongst crowes to be devoured dead, then amongst <hi>Para|sites</hi> to be devoured living. Therfore it wil be an argument of wisdome, for us to deale with you, who hath brought such plagues upon the common-weale, &amp; disturbed our peace by your slanderous iudgements, as <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> did with two of his subiects, men of vile conditi|ons; he cōmanded one to fly from <hi>Macedon,</hi> &amp; the other to follow him, which being done, his country was purged of such noxious sicophants: both departed but neitheir of them returned.</p>

For there if you are poisonous you cannot live long but if you resolve to chang your conditions aswell as your haire, you shall in those Ilands have a temperate ayre, and so wholsome for your bodys, that you will scarcely die, unlesse the world be so loathsome to you, or you unto the world! that you would wish rather to die then live, yea you shall have so much time given you through the temperatenesse of the aire, that your ensuing hours may redeem, what you have formerly spent amisse. This sentence is irrevocable; make no delays, we have provided you a ship but without cable, sterne, sayle yard or anchors, the (fatall semblance of your government,) to be known by these characters.</p>

                  <p>But if it seeme good to your wisdome, that the Church should have such degrees of <hi>higher</hi> and <hi>lower,</hi> we will have the Governours to be lay Elders. To which dig|nity, wee thinke non more fit, nor generally able to bee chosen, then our venerable brethren, the cobler, the bas|ket maker; and button maker, (whom although that De|micaster maker in Greens rents contended with, yet he ea|sily excelled in efficacy of doctrine and won the victory) being men of meane learning, but wonderfully inspired. But chiefely wee will, that you command <hi>Francis Helioke,</hi> henceforth to distinguish that Apochryphall name of <hi>Bishop,</hi> with an asteriske, amongst the absolete words to perpetuall remembrance. But as for the first Article of our complaint; as we would have no order in the church, so (to come unto the 2. we abhorre all rites and ceremo|nys; because whatsoever is ancient we iudge to be untrue, we disallow Priestly ornaments as well in the Presbytery, as lawne sleeves in a Bishop; we esteeme the Surplesse as the smocke of the whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the cope as <hi>Aegyp|tian</hi>
                     <pb facs="17"/>
embroydery: These Idolatrous Priests in their lin|nen appeare to us like Ghosts comming out of a Church yard. As for instruments of musick we esteeme them as prophane <hi>Babalonish tabers,</hi> yea wee cannot truly love our owne members because they are called organs.</p>

                  <p>As for the third article of our complaint: we will have no forme of common prayer: no not the Lords Prayer; for it shewes a diffidence of the Spirit: where|fore we neither will have praying nor preaching Mini|sters to be provided, but to speake extempore, that they may expresse the efficacy of the spirit: <hi>Turners</hi> Creede and his glosse concerning the communion of the Saints, we very well appove: and to comprehend all in generall.
