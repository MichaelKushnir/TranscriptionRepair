               <p>Friends with him? ſuch a baſe Raſcall? he is a very threed-bare fellow, I ſcorne, but my man <hi>Coller</hi> ſhould goe as well as hee euery day in the weeke, and be friends with him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ruffe.</speaker>
               <p>Thy man <hi>Coller?</hi> thy Maſter, thou wouldeſt haue ſaid, I am ſure hee is thy vp-hol|der.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cuffe.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, ſurely he is his Maſter, at leaſt his Maker: for <hi>Bands,</hi> make rags; Rags make Paper; Paper makes Paſt-board; and Paſt-board makes <hi>Collar;</hi> and I thinke that this is a ſtiffe argument that he is his Maſter.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ruffe.</speaker>
               <p>Well, be he what he will, if I catch his <hi>Collar,</hi> Ile cut him in iags, let mee but claſpe him, and Ile make him for ſtirring.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cuffe.</speaker>
               <p>But you ſhall not fight: haue you not Friends &amp; Neighbours enough to end this con|trouerſie, but you muſt goe into the fields, and there cut the threed of your liues? wee'l haue none of that, come chooſe you an Vmpire, <hi>Band,</hi> for it ſhall be ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Band.</speaker>
               <p>Since you will force me to it, if <hi>Ruffe</hi> be content, I am willing.</p>
            </sp>

               <speaker>Cuffe.</speaker>
               <p>

               <speaker>Ruffe.</speaker>
               <p>If I ſhall then, I muſt, let him name him.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>If I may chooſe, Ile haue Maſter <hi>Hand|kerchiefe.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cuffe.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, ſtay there, he is a moſt filthy Sni|veling
<pb facs="6"/>fellow, and he will wipe your Noſe of all, if you put the caſe to him, but what ſay you to <hi>Shirt?</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ruffe.</speaker>
               <p>He is a ſhifting knaue, and one, to whom <hi>Band,</hi> a little before hath beene much beholding, they were ioyned a long time togither in friend|ſhip.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Band.</speaker>
               <p>He is not in Towne.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ruffe.</speaker>
               <p>He is, for I ſaw <hi>Sock,</hi> his chiefe Foote|man in Towne.</p>

               <p>Well then, <hi>Ruffe</hi> ſhall bee moſt accoun|ted of amongſt the Clergie, for he is the graue Fellow (although I know, the <hi>Puritans</hi> will not greatly care for him, he hath ſuch a deale of ſet|ting, and they loue ſtanding very well.) As for
<pb facs="6"/>you, <hi>Band,</hi> you ſhall bee moſt made of amongſt the young Gal ants, although ſometimes they ſhall vſe <hi>Ruffe,</hi> for a faſhion, but not otherwiſe; how euer, you neede not regard the gid die hea|ded multitude, let them doe as they liſt, ſome|times reſpecting one, ſometimes the other: but when you come to the Counſailor, and men of Law, which know right from wrong, acknow|ledging Maſter Worths to bee equall, they ſhall preferre neither, but vſe the kindneſſe of you both, wearing both a <hi>Band</hi> and a <hi>Ruffe;</hi> how ſay you, are you both content?</p>
            </sp>
