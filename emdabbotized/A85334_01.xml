                           <l>Eaſily, thus. Our laws allow a cuſtome:</l>

                           <l>and he in ſtrickt ſeverity of right</l>
                           <l>cannot proceed againſt him, then he may</l>
                           <l>orewhelme him in a robe of mourning black,</l>
                           <l>which we have call'd deaths mantle: that thing done,</l>
                           <l>the man thus uſ'd, is forfeited to fate,</l>
                           <l>and a devoted ſacrifice to him</l>
                           <l>whom he had er'ſt offended, neither can</l>

                           <l>both which are treaſon and inexpiable.</l>
                           <l>Thus then you may proceed, when banquets done.</l>
