                     <l>When wandring <hi>Phoebes</hi> Iuory cheeks were scortcht</l>
                     <l>And all the earth like <hi>AEtna</hi> breathing fire:</l>

                     <l>To sway a throane as dangerous as his:</l>

                     <l>As pure and fiery as <hi>Phyteus</hi> beames,</l>
                     <l>The nature of these proud rebelling Iades</l>

                     </l>
                     <l>Through rocks more steepe and sharp than Caspian cliftes.</l>
                     <l>The nature of thy chariot wil not beare</l>
                     <l>A guide of baser temper than my selfe,</l>
                     <l>More then heauens coach, the pride of <hi>Phaeton.</hi>
