               <p>_I Suppose you are assembled here, supposing
to reape the fruite of my trauayles: and to be
playne, I meane presently to presente you
vvith a Comedie called Supposes, the verye
name vvherof may peraduenture driue into euery of
your heades a sundry Suppose, to suppose the mea|ning
of our supposes. Some percase vvill suppose we
meane to occupie your eares vvith sophisticall hand|ling
of subtill Suppositions. Some other vvill suppose
vve go about to discipher vnto you some queint con|ceiptes,
vvhich hitherto haue bene onely supposed
as it vvere in shadovves: and some I see smyling as
though they supposed vve vvould trouble you vvith
the vaine suppose of some vvanton Suppose. But vn|derstand,
this our Suppose is nothing else but a my|staking
or imagination of one thing for an other: for
you shall see the master supposed for the seruant, the
seruant for the master: the freeman for a slaue, and
the bondslaue for a freeman: the stranger for a vvell
knovven friend, and the familiar for a stranger. But
vvhat? I suppose that euen already you suppose me
very fonde, that haue so simply disclosed vnto you
the subtilties of these our Supposes: vvhere other|vvise
in deede I suppose you shoulde haue hearde
almoste the laste of our Supposes, before you coulde
haue supposed anye of them arighte. Let this then
suffise.</p>

it were inough for you secretly to reioyce, that by my helpe
you haue passed so many pleasant nightes togither, and yet
by my trouth I do it more than halfe agaynst my will, for
I would rather you had setled your fansie in some noble fa|milie,
yea and it is no small griefe vnto me, that reiecting
the suites of so many nobles and gentlemen, you haue cho|sen
for your darling a poore seruaunt of your fathers, by
whome shame and infamie is the best dower you can looke
for to attayne.</p>

nourse, that continually praysing him, what for his per|sonage,
his curtesie, and aboue all, the extreme passions of
<pb n="2" facs="6"/>
his minde, in fine you would neuer cease till I accepted
him, delighted in him, and at length desired him with no
lesse affection, than he earst desired me.</p>

him vnto you (as in déede I may say that for my

affection, and that continually he neuer ceassed to fill mine
eares with lamentable complaynts.</p>

                     <p>Well you may iudge of Nourse as you liste: In déede
I haue thought it alwayes a déede of charitie to helpe
the miserable yong men, whose tender youth consumeth
with the furious flames of loue: but be you sure if I had
thought you would haue passed to the termes you nowe
stande in, pitie nor pencion, peny nor pater noster shoulde
euer haue made Nurse once to opē hir mouth in the cause.</p>

nor any of so meane estate, but haue bestowed my loue
more worthily than thou déemest, but I will say no more
at this time.</p>

she shoulde reueale it? you haue trusted me as farre as
may be, I may shewe to you, in things that touche your

things wherof heretofore you haue made me priuie.</p>

                     <p>Well, it is of greater importance than you thinke

                     <p>Holde thy talking nourse, and harken to me, that I
may explane the whole case vnto thée: the man whome to
this day you haue supposed to be <hi>Dulipo,</hi> is (as I say) <hi>Ero|strato,</hi>
a gentleman that came from <hi>Sicilia</hi> to studie in this
Citie, &amp; euen at his first arriuall met me in the stréet, fel en|amored
of me, &amp; of suche vehement force were the passions
he suffred, that immediatly he cast aside both long gowne
and bookes, &amp; determined on me only to apply his study: and
to the end he might the more cōmodiously bothe sée me and
talke with me, he exchanged both name, habite, clothes and
credite with his seruāt <hi>Dulipo,</hi> whō only he brought with
him out of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> and so with the turning of a hand, of <hi>Ero|strato</hi>
a gentleman, he became <hi>Dulipo</hi> a seruing man, and
soone after sought seruice of my father, and obteyned it.</p>

                     <p>Yea out of doubt, on the other side <hi>Dulippo</hi> took●
vppon him the name of <hi>Erostrato</hi> his maister, the habite,
the credite, bookes, and all things néedefull to a studente,
and in shorte space profited very muche, and is nowe estée|med
as you sée.</p>

you howe hang these thinges togither? that the studente

                     <p>Yea, where no man knoweth the cōtrarie: but let
him braue it, bost his birth, and do what he can, the vertue
and knowledge that is within this body of yours, is worth

in déede I may say, and say truely, that my knowledge
hath stoode me in better stéede at a pinche, than coulde all
the goodes in the worlde. I came out of <hi>Otranto</hi> when the
Turkes wonne it, and first I came to <hi>Padua,</hi> after hither;
where by reading, counsailing, and pleading, within twen|tie

                     <p>Sure who so euer wrote it, the moral is excellent,
and worthy to be written in letters of golde: but to the

                  <p>O Miserable couetous wretche, he findeth an excuse by
S Nicholas fast, because I should not dine with him,
as though I should dine at his owne dishe: he maketh good|ly
feasts I promise you, it is no wonder though he thinke
me bounde vnto him for my fare: for ouer and besides that
his prouision is as skant as may be, yet there is great diffe|rence
<pb n="9" facs="9"/>
betwéene his diet and mine. I neuer so much as s●ppe
of the wyne that he tasteth, I feede at the bords ende with
broune bread: Marie I reach always to his owne dishe, for
there are no more but that only on the table: Yet he thinks
that for one such diner I am bound to do him al the seruice
that I can, and thinks me sufficiently rewarded for all my
trauell, with one suche festiuall promotion: and yet perad|uenture
some men thinke I haue great gaynes vnder him:
but I may say and sweare, that this dosen yere I haue not
gayned so muche in value as the poynts at my hose (which
are but thrée with codpéece poynt and al): he thinks that I
may féede vpon his fauour and fayre words: but if I could
not otherwise prouide for one, <hi>Pasiphilo</hi> were in a wyse
case. <hi>Pasiphilo</hi> hath mo pastures to passe in than one, I
warrant you: I am of housholde with this scholer <hi>Erostra|to,</hi>
his riuale, as wel as with <hi>Domine Cleander,</hi> now with
the one, and then with the other, according as I sée their
Caters prouide good chéere at the market: and I finde the
meanes so to handle the matter, that I am welcome to
bothe. If the one sée me talke with the other, I make
him beléeue it is to harken newes in the furtherance of his
cause, and thus I become a broker on both sides. Well, let
them bothe apply the matter as well as they can, for in
déede I will trauell for none of them bothe: yet wyll I
séeme to worke wonders on eche hande. But is not this
one of <hi>Damons</hi> seruants that commeth foorth? it is, of him
I shall vnderstande where his master is. Whither goeth

                  </sp>
                  <p>Hard hap had I when I first begon this vnfortunate en|terprise,
for I supposed the readiest medicine to my misera|ble
effect●s had bene to change name, clothes, &amp; credite with
my seruant, &amp; to place my selfe in <hi>Damons</hi> seruice, thinking
that as sheuering colde by glowing fire, thurst by drinke,
hunger by pleasant repasts, and a thousande suche like pas|sions
finde remedie by their contraries, so my restles desire
might haue founde quiet by continuall contemplation. But
alas, I finde that only loue is vnsaciable, for as the flie play|eth
with the flame till at last she is cause of hir owne decay,
so the louer that thinketh with kissing and colling to con|tent
his vnbrideled apetite, is cōmonly sene the onely cause
of his owne consumption: Two yéeres are now paste since
vnder the colour of <hi>Damons</hi> seruice I haue bene a sworne
seruant to <hi>Cupid,</hi> of whō I haue receiued as muche fauour
&amp; grace as euer man founde in his seruice, I haue frée liber|tie
at al times to behold my desired, to talke with hir, to em|brace
hir, yea (be it spoken in secrete) to lye with hir, I reape
the fruites of my desire, yet as my ioyes abounde, euen so
<pb n="11" facs="10"/>
my paines encrease, I fare like the couetous man, that ha|uing
all the worlde at will, is neuer yet content, the more I
haue, the more I desire. Alas, what wretched estate haue I
brought my selfe vnto, if in the ende of all my farre fetches,
she be giuē by hir father to this olde doting doctor, this bu|zard,
this bribing villaine, that by so many meanes seketh to
obtaine hir at hir fathers hands? I know she loueth me best
of all others, but what may that preuaile when perforce she
shalbe constrained to marie another? Alas, y^● pleasant taste
of my sugred ioyes doth yet remaine so perfect in my remē|brance,
that the least soppe of sorow séemeth more soure th●̄
gall in my mouth: if I had neuer knowen delight, with bet|ter
contentatiō might I haue passed these dreadful dolours.
And if this olde .M. impsimus (whom the pockes consume)
should wyn hir, then may I saye, farewell the pleasant talk,
the kind embracings, yea farewel the sight of my <hi>Polynesta,</hi>
for he like a ielouse wretch will pen ●ir vp, that I thinke
the birdes of the aire shall not wynne the sighte of hir. I ho|ped
to haue caste a blocke in his waye, by the meanes that
my seruaunt, who is supposed to be <hi>Erostrato,</hi> and with my
habite and credite is well estemed, should proffer himselfe a
suter, at the least to counteruaile the doctors profers: but
my maister knowing the wealth of the one, and doubting
the state of the other, is determined to be fed no longer with
faire wordes, but to accept the doctor, (whom he right well
knoweth) for his sonne in law: well, my seruaunt promised
me yesterday to deuise yet againe some newe conspiracie to
driue maister doctor out of conceite, and to laye a snare that
the foxe himselfe might be caughte in, what it is, I knowe
not, nor I saw him not since he went about it: I will goe sée
if he be within, that at least if he helpe me not, he maye yet
prolong my life for this once. But here commeth his lackie,

had him home to supper, where by suche meanes as I v|sed,
he became my great friend, and tolde me the whole or|der

my father?</p>

                  <sp>

                     <p>I sayde further, that I receyued letters lately from
my father, whereby I vnderstoode that he woulde be héere
very shortly to performe all that I had profered: therfore I
required him to request <hi>Damō</hi> on my behalf, that he would
stay his promise to the doctor for a fourthnight or more.</p>

                     <p>This is somewhat yet, for by this meanes I shal be
sure to linger and liue in hope one fourthnight longer, but
at the fourthnights ende when <hi>Philogono</hi> commeth not,
how shall I then do? yea and though he came, howe may
I any way hope of his consent, when he shall sée, that to fol|low
this amorous enterprise, I haue set aside all studie, all
remembraunce of my duetie, and all dread of shame. Alas,
alas, I may go hang my selfe.</p>

                     <p>Well, harken a while then: this morning I tooke
my horse and rode into the fieldes to solace my selfe, and as
I passed the foorde beyonds <hi>S. Anthonies</hi> gate, I met at the
foote of the hill a gentleman riding with two or thrée men,
and as me thought by his habite and his lookes, he should be
<pb n="15" facs="12"/>
none of the wise●●. He saluted me, and I him: I asked him
from whence he came, and whither he would? he answered
that he had come from <hi>Venice,</hi> then from <hi>Padua,</hi> nowe
was going to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and so to his countrey, whiche is
<hi>Scienna:</hi> As soone as I knowe him to be a <hi>Scenese,</hi> sodenly
lifting vp mine eyes, as it were with an admiration I sayd
vnto him, are you a <hi>Scenese,</hi> and come to <hi>Ferrara?</hi> why not,
sayde he: quoth I, halfe and more with a trembling voyce,
know you the daunger that should ensue if you be knowne
in <hi>Ferrara</hi> to be a <hi>Scenese?</hi> he more than halfe amased, de|sired
me earnestly to tell him what I ment.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Du.</speaker>
                     <p>I vnderstande not wherto this tendeth.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ero.</speaker>
                     <p>I beléeue you, but hearken to me.</p>
                  </sp>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ero.</speaker>
                     <p>I answered him in this sorte: Gentleman, bicause
I haue heretofore founde very curteous entertaynement
in your countrey, béeing a student there, I accompt my selfe
as it were bounde to a <hi>Scenese,</hi> and therefore if I knewe of
any mishappe towards any of that countrey, God forbid but
I should disclose it: and I maruell that you knowe not of
the iniurie that your countreymen offered this other day to
the Embassadours of <hi>Countie Hercule.</hi>

to me?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ero.</speaker>
                     <p>If you will harken a whyle, you shall finde them
no tales, but that they appertayne to you more than you
thinke for.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Du.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Ero.</speaker>
                     <p>I tolde him further, these Ambassadoures of
<hi>Countie Hercule</hi> had dyuers Mules, Waggons, and Cha|rettes,
laden with diuers costly iewels, gorgious furniture,
&amp; other things which they caried as presents, passing that
way to the king of <hi>Naples▪</hi> the which were not only stayd in
<hi>Sciene</hi> by the officers whō you cal Customers, but serched,
ransacked, tossed &amp; turned, &amp; in the end exacted for tribute, as
<pb n="16" facs="13"/>
if they had bene the goods of a meane marchaunt.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Du.</speaker>
                     <p>Whither the diuell will he? is it possible that this

                  <sp>

                     <speaker>Ero.</speaker>
                     <p>I procéeded, that vpon these causes the Duke sent
his Chauncelor to declare the case vnto the Senate there,
of whom he had the moste vncurteous answere that euer
was heard, whervpon he was so enraged with all of that
countrey, that for reuēge he had sworne to spoyle as many
of them as euer should come to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and to sende them
home in their dublet and their hose.</p>

                     <p>You would fayne leape ouer the stile, before you
come at the hedge: I woulde you had heard me, and séene

                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Du.</speaker>

                     <p>Further I sayde, the duke had charged vpon great
penalties, that the Inholders and vitlers shoulde bring
worde dayly of as many <hi>Sceneses</hi> as came to their houses:
the gentlemā béeing (as I gessed at the first) a man of smal
<hi>sapientia,</hi> when he heard these newes, would haue turned
his horse an other way.</p>

                     <speaker>Du.</speaker>
                     <p>By likelyhoode he was not very wise when he
would beléeue that of his cūntrey, which if it had bene true,
euery man must néedes haue knowen it.</p>

                     <p>Why not? when he had not béene in his countrey
for a moneth paste, and I tolde him this had hapned within

if I punishe my seruant according to his diuelishe de|serts,
I shall heape further cares vpon mine owne head,
for to suche detestable offences no punishment can séeme
sufficient, but onely death: &amp; in such cases it is not lawfull
for a man to be his owne caruer, the lawes are ord●yned,
and officers appoynted to minister iustice for the redresse
of wrongs: and if to the potestates I complayne me, I shal
publishe mine owne reproche to the worlde: yea, what
should it preuayle me to vse all the punishments that can
be deuised? the thing once done can not be vndone. My
daughter is defloured, and vtterly dishonested, howe can I
then wype that blot off my browe? and on whome shall I
séeke reuenge? Alas, alas, I my selfe haue bene the cause of
all these cares, and haue deserued to beare the punishment
of all these mishappes. Alas, I should not haue committed
my dearest darling in custodie to so carelesse a creature as
this olde Nourse: for we sée by common proofe, that these
olde women be either péeuishe, or to pitifull: either easily
enclined to euill, or quickly corrupted with bribes and re|wards.
O wife, my good wife (that nowe lyest colde in the
graue) now may I well bewayle the wante of thée, and
mourning nowe may I bemone that I misse thée: if thou
hadst liued, such was thy gouernement of the least things,
that thou wouldest prudently haue prouided for the preser|uation
of this pearle: a costly iewell may I well accompte
hir, that hath béen my chéefe comforte in youth, and is nowe
become the coro●●ue of mine age. O <hi>Polynesta,</hi> full euill hast
thou requ●●ed the clemencie of thy carefull father, and yet to
excuse thée giltlesse before God, and to condemne thée giltie
before the worlde, I can count none other but my wretched
selfe the caytife and causer of all my cares: for of all the due|ties
that are requisite in humane lyfe, onely obedience is
by the parents to be required of the childe, where on y^e other
<pb n="30" facs="20"/>
side the parēts are bound, first to beget them, then to bring
thē foorth, after to nourish them, to preserue them from bo|dily
perils in the cradle, from daunger of soule by godly e|ducation,
to matche them in comfort enclined to vertue, to
banish them all ydle and wanton companie, to allow them
sufficiente for their sustentation, to cut of excesse the open
gate of sinne, seldome or neuer to smile on them vnlesse it
be to their encouragement in vertue, and finally, to prouide
them mariages in time cōuenient, lest neglected of vs, they
learne to sette either to much or to litle by themselues: fiue
yeares are past since I might haue maried hir, when by con|tinuall
excuses I haue prolonged it to my owne perdition:
Alas, I shoulde haue considered, she is a collop of my owne
flesh, what should I thinke to make hir a princesse? Alas a|las,
a poore kingdome haue I now caught to endue hir with:
it is too true, that of all sorowes this is the head source and
chiefe fountaine of all furies: the goods of the worlde are in|certaine,
the gaines to be reioyced at, and the losse not great|ly
to be lamented, only the children cast away, cutteth the
parents throate with the knife of inward care, which knife
will kill me surely, I make none other accoumpte.</p>

he shal be sure of mo than one at a clap that catcheth hir, ey|ther
Adam or Eue within hir bellie: oh God how men may
be deceiued in a woman: who wold haue beléeued the con|trary
but that she had bin a virgin? aske the neighbours and
you shal heare very good report of hir, marke hir behauiors
&amp; you would haue iudged hir very maydenly, seldome seene

abroade but in place of prayer, and there very deuout, and
no gaser at outwarde sightes, no blaser of hir beautie aboue

would haue thought hir a holy yong woman. But muche
good doe it you <hi>Domine Doctor,</hi> he shall be sure to lacke no

beshrewe me if I let the mariage any way. But is not this

I held my peace, and neuer tolde it. Now this other day the

<pb n="33" facs="21"/>
knew well enoughe howe often she had brought <hi>Dulipo</hi> to
<hi>Polynestas</hi> bed: yet all this while I thought not that anye

                     <p>Well, this passage shall seme pleasant vnto you whē
you shall finde your childe in health and well: but I praye
you sir why did you not rather send for him into <hi>Sicilia,</hi> thā
to come your selfe, specially since you had none other busi|nesse?
peraduenture you had rather endanger your selfe by
this noysome iourney, than hazard to drawe him from hys
studie.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
                     <p>Nay, that was not y^● matter, for I had rather haue
him giue ouer his studie altogether and come home.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Fer.</speaker>
                     <p>Why? if you minded not to make him learned, to
what ende did you send him hither at the first?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
                     <p>I will tell you: when he was at home he did as most
yong men doe, he played many mad prankes and did many
things that liked me not very well, and I thinking, that by
that time he had sene the worlde, he would learne to know
himselfe better, exhorted him to studie, and put in his electiō
what place he would go to. At the last he came hither, and I
thinke he was scarce here so sone as I felt the want of him,
in suche sorte, as from that daye to this I haue passed fewe
nightes without teares: I haue written to him very often
that he shoulde come home, but continually he refused still,
beseching me to continue his studie, wherin he doubted not
(as he said) but to profite greatly.</p>

                     <p>In dede he is very much commended of all men, and
specially of the best reputed studentes.</p>

                     <p>I am glad he hath not lost his time, but I care not
<pb n="45" facs="23"/>
greatly for so muche knowledge, I woulde not be without
the sighte of hym againe so long, for all the learning in the
worlde. I am olde nowe, and if God shoulde call mée in
his absence, I promise you I thinke it woulde driue me
into desperation.</p>

                     <speaker>Fer.</speaker>
                     <p>It is commendable in a man to loue his childrē, but
to be so tender ouer them is more womanlike?</p>

                     <speaker>Phi.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, I confesse it is my faulte: and yet I will tell
you another cause of my comming hither, more waightie
than this. Diuers of my countrey haue bene here since he
came hither, by whom I haue sente vnto him, and some of
thē haue bene thrice, some foure or fiue times at his house,
and yet could neuer speake with him: I feare he applies his
studie so, that he will not léese the minute of an houre from
his booke. What, alas, he might yet talke with his country|men
for a while, he is a yong man, tenderly brought vp, and
if he fare thus continually night and day at his booke, it may
be enough to driue him into a frenesie.</p>

me burst out these swelling teares, which hitherto with
great payne I haue prisoned in my brest, &amp; least he should
heare the Eccho of my doubled sighes, which bounce from
the botome of my heuy heart. O cursed I, O cruell fortune,
that so many dispersed griefes as were sufficient to sub●ert
a legion of Louers, hast sodenly assembled within my care|full
carcase to freat this fearfull heart in sunder with de|speration:
thou that hast kepte my master all his youthe
within the realme of <hi>Sicilia▪</hi> reseruing the wind and waues
in a temperate calme (as it were at his commaunde) nowe
to conuey his aged limmes hither, neither sooner nor la|ter,
but euen in the worst time that may be: if at any time
before thou haddest conducted him, this enterprise had bene
<pb n="58" facs="30"/>
cut off without care in the beginning: and if neuer so little
longer thou hadst lingred his iorney, this happie day might
then haue fully finished our driftes and deuises. But alas,
thou hast brought him euē in the very worst time, to plunge
vs all in the pitte of perdition. Neither art thou content to
entangle me alone in thy ruinous ropes, but thou must al|so
catche the righte <hi>Erostrato</hi> in thy crooked clawes, to re|warde
vs bothe with open shame and rebuke. Two yeres
hast thou kepte secret our subtil Supposes, euen this day to
discipher them with a sorowfull successe. What shall I do?
Alas what shifte shall I make? it is too late nowe to ima|gine
any further deceite, for euery minute séemeth an houre
till I find some succour for the miserable captiue <hi>Erostrato.</hi>
Well, since there is no other remedie, I wil go to my ma|ster
<hi>Philogano,</hi> and to him will I tell the whole truthe of
the matter, that at the least he may prouide in time, before
his sonne féele the smart of some sharpe reuenge &amp; punish|ment:
this is the best, and thus will I do: yet I know, that
for mine owne parte I shal do bitter penance for my faults
forepassed: but suche is the good wil and duetie that I beare
to <hi>Erostrato,</hi> as euen with the losse of my life I muste not
sticke to aduenture any thing which may turne to his cō|moditie.
But what shall I do? shall I go séeke my master
about the towne, or shall I tarrie his returne hither? If I
méete him in the stréetes, he will crie out vpon me, neither
will he harken to any thing that I shall say, till he haue ga|thered
all the people woondring about me, as it were at an
Owle. Therefore I were better to abide here, and yet if he
tarrie long, I will go séeke him, rather than prolong the
time to <hi>Erostratos</hi> perill.</p>

you by and by, both <hi>Philogano</hi> this worthie man, and mai|ster
doctor <hi>Cleander.</hi>

                        <hi>Cleander?</hi> Why therby lies another tale, the moste
fortunate aduenture that euer you heard: wot you what?
this other <hi>Dulipo,</hi> whom all this while we supposed to be
<hi>Erostrato,</hi> is founde to be the sonne of <hi>Cleander,</hi> whom he
lost at the losse of <hi>Otranto,</hi> and was after solde in <hi>Sicilia</hi> to
this <hi>Philogano,</hi> the strangest case that euer you heard: a mā
might make a Comedie of it, they wil come euen straight,
and tell you the whole circumstance of it themselues.</p>

                     <p>Nay I will first goe heare the storie of this <hi>Dulipo,</hi>
be it <hi>Dulipo</hi> or <hi>Erostrato</hi> that I heare within, before I
speake with <hi>Philogano.</hi>

they may stay a while, but loke where they come.</p>

as many as heare it, will take great pleasure in it, and you
<hi>Philogano</hi> may thinke, that god in heauen aboue, hath or|dained

s●fficient amendes, being borne in <hi>Cathanea</hi> of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> of a
