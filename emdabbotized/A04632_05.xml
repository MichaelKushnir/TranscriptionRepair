                     <hi>AELius Seianus,</hi> sonne to <hi>Seius Strabo,</hi> a gentleman of <hi>Rome,</hi> and borne at <hi>Vulsinium,</hi> after his long seruice in court: first, vnder <hi>Augustus,</hi> afterward, <hi>Tiberius:</hi> grew into that fauour with the latter, and won him by those artes, as there wanted nothing, but the name, to make him a copartner of the Em|pire. Which greatnesse of his, <hi>Drusus,</hi> the Emperors sonne not broo|king, after many smother'd dislikes, it one day breaking out, the <hi>Prince</hi> strooke him publikely on the face. To reuenge which disgrace, <hi>Liuia,</hi> the wife of <hi>Drusus</hi> (being before corrupted by him to her dis|honour, and the discouery of her husbands councells) <hi>Seianus</hi> practi|seth with, together with her Physitian, called <hi>Eudemus,</hi> and on●<hi>Lygdus,</hi> an Eunuch, to poyson <hi>Drusus.</hi> This their inhumane act hauing successefull, and vnsuspected passage, it emboldeneth <hi>Seianus</hi> to farther, &amp; more insolent proiects, euen the ambition of the Empire: where finding the lets, he must encounter, to be many, &amp; hard, in re|spect of the issue of <hi>Germanicus</hi> (who were next in hope for the suc|cession) he deuiseth to make <hi>Tiberius</hi> selfe, his meanes: &amp; instill's in|to his eares many doubts, and suspicions, both against the Princes, and their mother <hi>Agrippina</hi>: which <hi>Caesar</hi> iealously hearkning to, as co|uetously consenteth to their ruine, and their friends. In this time, the better to mature and strengthen his designe, he labours to marry <hi>Li|uia,</hi> and worketh (with all his ingine) to remoue <hi>Tiberius</hi> from the knowledge of publike businesse, with allurements of a quiet and retyred life: the latter of which, <hi>Tiberius</hi> (out of a pronenesse to lust, and a desire to hide those vnnaturall pleasures, which he could not so publikely practise) embraceth: the former inkindleth his feares, and there giues him first cause of doubt, or suspect toward <hi>Seianus.</hi> Against whom, he raiseth (in priuate) a new instrument, one <hi>Serto|rius Macro,</hi> and by him vnder-worketh, discouers the others coun|sells, his meanes, his ends, sounds the affections of the <hi>Senators,</hi> di|uides, distracts them: at last, when <hi>Seianus</hi> least looketh, and is most secure (with pretext of doing him an vn-wonted honour in the <hi>Senate</hi>) he traines him from his guardes, with one letter, and in one day, hath him suspected, accused, condemned, and torne in pieces, by the rage of the people,</p>

                           <p>IF you, Conscript Fathers, with your children, bee in health, it is aboun|dantly well: wee with our friends here, are so. The care of the common-wealth, howsoeuer we are remoou'd in person, cannot be absent to our thought; although, oftentimes, euen to princes most present, the truth of their owne af|faires is hid: then which, nothing fals out more miserable to a state, or makes the art of gouerning more difficult. But since it hath beene our ease-full happinesse to enioy both the aides, and industrie of so vigilant a Senate, wee professe to haue beene the more indulgent to our pleasures, not as being carelesse of our office, but rather secure of the necessitie. Neyther doe these common rumors of many, and infamous libels, published against our retirement, at all afflict vs; being born more out of mens ignorance, then their malice: and will, neglected, finde their owne graue quickly; whereas too sensibly acknowledg'd, it would make their obloquie ours. Nor doe we desire their authors (though found) bee censur'd, since in a free state (as ours) all men ought to enioy both their mindes, and tongues free.</p>
