               <p>_IF ever Dog was weary of a
day, then have I cause to bee
weary of my life; I am a
Blacksmith by my Trade, and
(though I say it) I have bin
accounted a good Workman,
but I could never yet forge, or hammer out means
enough to satisfie the insatiate gut of my son <hi>Simple|ton.</hi>
He will not work, and yet no sooner is his nose
out of the Alehouse, but his head is in the Cupboard:
His insatiate stomach may well defie a Giant, or the
great Eater of <hi>Kent;</hi> but I have thought upon a way
which he shall either take in hand, or graze with
Hobb my horse; Sirrah <hi>Simpleton,</hi> where are you?</p>

               <p>I do not think there is such a genteel
Smith in the town, that has such an old niggardly
Coxcombe to his father as I, he knows I have no
better a stomach then a young green-sicknesse girle,
and yet he grutches me every bit I eat.</p>

musick will hardly have the virtue to waken her, and
if she should wake, I could not tell what to say to
her unless it were to desire her to go to bed again.
And because I will be sure to be acceptable to her, I

sweet-swotterkin, and if you please to throw your

one of the faithfullest lovers that ever took hammer

               <p>I see him coming back; and truth to say,
the course I shall advise will seem a strange one, yet
it must be: you know he did appoint that I should
buie for him a pair of Bellows; now if you two can
bear it lustily, and blow it strongly, this visit may be
kept off from his knowledge.</p>

that if we lay out all the money in a pair of Bellows,
we should have little or nothing left to buy victu|alls.</p>

is an alamoda pair of Bellows, but look you <hi>Doll;</hi>
when the Bellows-mender comes by, let him stop
this hole here, for the winde comes out abominably.
<hi>I</hi>'le call my Father <hi>Simpleton</hi> to see this pair of Bel|lows.
Father, father, come hither.</p>
