                     <p>Good Master Steward, give Order for some Beef-suet to be brought in: for there is nor any left in the House, and I must make a Venison-pasty; and if I should temper my Pasty all with butter, you would be angry.</p>

                     <p>Yes, if every one that eat of it had as fresh a mouth as you, or lo|ved drink so well as you do, it would serve, otherwise it would be too salt for their palats; besides, I am to make puddings in guts.</p>

                     <p>If they prove as the last you made, the dogs may eat them

for the guts stunk so much, as no man could eat any of them.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Briget.</speaker>
                     <p>I'm sure 'twas your fault, in that you did not bring me where|withall to make them, until such time as the guts began to putrifie.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Thrifty.</speaker>
                     <p>No, no, you are a Slut, and did not take all the dung out of them, nor wash, nor scrape, nor cleanse them as they should have been; but you order the guts, as you do the dishes, the one is dungy; the other greasie; be|sides, my Master complains, that his Fowl taste rank, and his Brawn tasts strong, and his Beef tasts musty, and that's because you are so lazy, as not to shift your Brawn into fresh Sousing-drink, nor make the brine strong enough in the powdring-tub, nor thrust your fingers far enough into the Fowls rumps, to draw them clean; besides, when they are roasted, they are as dry as a chip, for want of basting-butter; besides, your sluttery is such, as you will poyson all the House: for in one place I find a piece of butter, and a greasie comb full of nitty hairs lying by it; and in another place flour and old-worn stockings, the feet being rotted off with sweat; and in a third place, a dish of cold meat cover'd with a foul smock, and your durty shooes (for the most part) stand upon the Dresser-board, where you lay the hot meat; besides, by your carelesness you do waste and spoil so much, as it is unsufferable: for you will fling whole ladlefuls of dripping into the fire, to make the fire blaze underneath the pot; and because you have not the profit of the Kitchin-stuff, you will never scrape the Dresser-board, nor Dripping-pans, nor lick the Platters, Trays, or Scummers, Frying-pans, Skillets, Gridirons, Spits, Ladles, Kettles, or any of the Kitchin-vessels, as you should doe, but wash them all with hot water at first, without taking off the grease before|hand.</p>

                     <p>Well, if you do not like me, pray pay me my wages, and I will be gone: I'm sure I never serv'd in any place for so small wages and few vails as in this service: I'm sure 'tis no ways beneficial to me.</p>

                     <p>I'm sure you'l make it beneficial one way or another: for you have your female Factors that lie abroad, to whom you send Commodities by your She-porters, that come hither every day to transport them. Thus you traffique upon my Masters Cost, and my Reputation: for I am thought the worse of either, as believing I am a false Steward, or a negligent one. Thus a True man is thought a Knave: for by your stealing I am thought a Thief.</p>

                     <p>I am very well acquainted with him, Lady: for he is my most noble Friend.</p>

                     <p>That he might do, if it were for no other reason, but for a Nurse to tend him, if he should chance to be sick.</p>

                     <p>By your favour, Lady, it were dangerous for a sick man to be maried, especially to a fair young Lady.</p>

                     <speaker>Gentlem.</speaker>
                     <p>So he told me.</p>

                     <speaker>Gentlem.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes Madam, I had it first from his own mouth.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Gentlem.</speaker>
                     <p>Truly I heard not what portion she had; but I suppose if she had been rich, her wealth would have made her famous.</p>

                     <p>No indeed, Lady, I heard not any body speak of her but him|self, and that was only, That he was to marry a young Lady in that City he was in, and that he thought would be the cause to perswade him to settle in that Country.</p>

                     <p>She is become very fine upon her preferment: I am sure it is not five or ten pound wages that will or can maintain her at that rate she goes: for she hath had, to my knowledge, two new pair of shooes within three weeks of each other; whereupon I told her, that the shooes that she cast by, would be very strong and serviceable, if they were cobled; and her Answer was, what, did I think she would wear cobled shooes? I told her, why not now, as well as she did? for she us'd to send her shooes to be cobled three or four times over, and her wastcoat to be patch'd, and her petticoats to be new-border'd, and her stockings to be heel'd, as the rest of us did; and I knew of no Lands that had befallen her, and therefore she may doe the same still.</p>

But if he be constant, may all the Masculine Sex be bless'd for his sake; may all women desire, admire, and love him; may Pleasure imbrace him, Health preserve him, and Time attend him; may he be arm'd with Power, crown'd with Peace, and all Obedience bow to his command; may the sound but of his Name bring joy to all hearts; may all be pleas'd for his Birth, pray for his Life, and fear his Death; may good Fortune trace his ways, whilst he tides upon the wings of a glorious Fame.</p>

Alas said I, I have forgot it; but hold you the candle, said I, and I will run and fetch the stick strait, and so I put the candle into her hand: with that, she up with her hand, and gave me a box on the ear, what, said she, do you give me a greasie candle to hold?

from a Chambermaid to a Gentlewoman, I might easily mistake; besides, she is not so much older, as to have much more experience than my self: perchance she may have more craft, which was learned her in her poverty, than I, who have been bred at the Horn of Plenty, that knew no scar|city, nor sharking necessity.</p>

                     <p>Sweet-heart, I was in your Bed-chamber, and in your Cabinet-chamber, and missing you in both, I was afraid I must have been forc'd to have hir'd a Cryer, to have proclamed my loss.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <p>Many a Wife doth proclame her Husbands loss without the help of a Cryer: for the Wives Adulterous Acts proclame her Husband a Cuc|old, and the loss of his Honour.</p>

                     <speaker>Sage.</speaker>
                     <p>But I am not afra'd of that: for I am confident of thy Chastity (al|though the old saying is, <hi>Confidence makes Cuckolds.</hi>)</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>

                     <p>But your too serious studies will harm your health; and if you be sick, I cannot be well; besides, it will decay your Beauty, waste your Youth, like Oyl spent in a melancholy Lamp, where Life is always blinking.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Chastity.</speaker>
                     <p>It were better that my Body should be sick, than my Mind idle; my Beauty decay, than my Understanding perish; my Youth waste, than my Fame lost; my Life blinking, than my Honour sinking: for an idle Mind, not well imploy'd creates a restless body, which runs from place to place, and hates to be at home. Thus Mind and Body both being out, extravagant Words and Actions run about, and Riot keeps possession.</p>
                     <l>And though the Beauty withers and decays,</l>
                     <l>Yet Wit and Wisedome with the ruine stays:</l>
                     <l>And if the Youth doth waste, and Life's Oyl's spent,</l>
                     <l>Yet Fame lasts long, and builds a Monument:</l>
                     <l>A melancholy life doth shadows cast,</l>
                     <l>But sets forth Virtue, if they are well plac'd.</l>
                     <l>Then who would entertain an idle Mirth,</l>
                     <l>Begot by Vanity, and dies in scorn?</l>
                     <l>Or proud, or pleas'd with Beauty, when the Birth</l>
                     <l>Becomes the Grave or Tomb as soon as born?</l>
                     <l>But Wisedome wishes to be old and glad,</l>
                     <l>When youthful Follies die, which seem as mad:</l>
                     <l>If Age is subject to repent what's past,</l>
                     <l>Prudence and Experience redeems what's lost.</l>

The Heavens can|not condemn me for cursing a man which hath betray'd my Youth by Flattery, violated my Chastity by Proteslations, tormented my harmless thoughts with Perjury, disquiet|ing my peaceable Life with Misfortunes.

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Inconstant.</speaker>
                     <p>For Perjury and Murther: for I did not only break those Bonds I had sealed with holy Vows, but my Falshood hath kill'd a fair young La|dy: for she hearing I had forsaken her, and was to be maried to another, she dy'd for grief.</p>

                     <p>Alas Sir, we are all by Nature both frail and mortal: wherefore we must complain of Nature, of her Inconstancy and Cruelty, in making our Minds so changeable, and our Bodies so weak, the one being subject to Death, the other subject to Variety. But Sir, in my Opinion, you have no cause to grieve, but rather to rejoyce: for what you have erred by Nature, you have repaired by Fortunes favour: for if that Lady which is dead, had lived, you would have been incumber'd with many troubles.</p>

                     <p>Why you would have been as a young Bear baired by two young Whelps; the forsaken Lady railing and exclaming against you in all Com|pany she came into, and your Wife tormenting you with sharp words and loud noise, insomuch as you would have neither ear, drank, or slept in quiet. Thus both abroad and at home you would have heard noth gbut your own reproaches.</p>

                     <p>No faith Sir: for Death hath stopt the mouth of the one, and Kisses may chance to muzzle the mouth of the other; but if you be melan|choly, your Lady will think you do repent, and will believe that you do pre|fer the memory of your dead Mistris, before the enjoyment of your living Wife; besides, women are so jealous, as they will not allow their Husbands to think (that makes them talk so much as they do) for they think Thoughts are Bauds to Adulterous Actions, and that Imaginations commit Fornicati|on with the Ghosts and Spirits of the dead.</p>

                     <p>O Madam, stolen pleasures are sweet, and Mariage is a Cloak to hide Love's meetings.</p>

                  <sp>

                     <p>And can it hide the sin from the Gods, and the falshood from my Husband, as well as from the World? But let me tell you, the World is quick-fighted as to Particulars, though blind as to the General, complaining against single crimes, yet never helps to mend them.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Procurer.</speaker>
                     <p>'Faith Madam, the Gods easily pardon natural faults, and Hus|bands dare not spy them, at least not to divulge them; and the World censures all the Virtuous as much as the Wicked, and the Chaste as much as the Wanton; besides, you are excusable, being maried to an antient man.</p>

                     <p>'Faith little: for Love wears out with Time, and Age wears out of Love; and if you said you did love your Husband, no body would believe you: for who can think you that are young and fair, can love a man that's old?</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Chastity.</speaker>
                     <p>No; but I can think it's like a Bank swell'd out by Generosity, to bear Necessities burdens on; or else a heap of Noble Deeds, fals'd by Heroick Actions, whereon Fame sits in Triumph, and blows his praise a|broad, that all the World may hear it.</p>

                     <p>No; but I can think them Tracks or Paths made by Experience, in which walks Prudence, Fortitude, Justice, and Temperance: And though you strive to make my Husband seem much older than he is, yet I believe that neither Time nor Age hath power over him: for to my sight his Skin is as smooth as Light, his Eyes as darting as <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Beams, his Body is as straight as <hi>Serzes</hi> Wand, able to charm the youngest she, and turn her all to Love; his Strength is active, and his Spirits quick, to carry Arms, or sight his Enewies; and for his Brain, 'tis equally temper'd, not burnt with heat, nor frozen up with cold; nor are his Sinews out of tune by flacken'd Nerves, but just set to Lifes Harmony, Strength strings the Cords, and Health doth keep just Time.</p>

                     <p>O Husband, I was dying of an Apoplexie, my Spirits were stopt, and my Brain was smother'd in a cloud of gross vapours; but your Man and my Maid falling out, they fell a bearing each other, and she crying out for help, did so affright me, as I came running hither, thinking Thieves had broken in, or Fire had broken out of our house, which fright hath un|stopt the Sluce-passages, and dispers'd the Vapour.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Lovewell.</speaker>
                     <p>I perceive a bad Cause may sometimes produce a good Effect, if their sighting hath cured you.</p>

                     <speaker>Hypocondria.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes; but I will turn away my Maid, for crying, and quarrel|ling, and making such a noise.</p>

                     <p>That were unjust: for should the sick Patient, that had been sick to death, when he was restored to health, banish the Physician that re|stored him, without a Fee? No, he ought to have his Fee doubl'd or trebl'd, so you ought not onely to keep your Maid, but to double or treble her wages.</p>

                     <p>It were more just to treble my wages than hers; for I was the cause of the Out-cry: for when I beat her, she roared, and her voice thorough her throat, made as great a rumbling noise, as a foul chimney set on fire, and in my Conscience as much sooty flegm fell from her head, as from a Cooks Chimney; and when she scolded, her words were so harsh, as they creeke just so as when a door is taken off the hinges, which made my Lady strait ap|prehend either Fire, or Thieves, or both.</p>

                     <p>No doubt, but she hath as much reason: for sure she doth it for gain, not out of love to wicked basenesse; but I believe poverty per|swades her, or rather inforces her.</p>

                     <p>No surely, it is an inborn, or at least an inbred baseness: for neither death, nor torments can inforce, nor riches, nor preferrments allure a noble mind to such base acts; but some are so unworthy, or rather wicked, as to de|light to intice, and to pervert all they can get acquaintance with.</p>

                     <p>Lord, Lord, this nasty love, or rather this heastly lust that doth corrupt all good manners, as gentle civility, free society, lawfull recreations, honest friendship, natural affections; it cuts off the feet of obedience, it breaks the knees of duty, it wounds the breast of fidelity, it pulls out the heart of loyalty; it turns away prudence, it banishes temperance, and murthers justice; it breaks peace and makes warrs, and t●rns arms i●●o petticoats. O sweet pure Chastity, how amiable thou art, how beautifull thou appearst in women, how heroick in men: for Chast women have such innocent thoughts, such pure, clean, clear, white immaculate minds, such modest countenances, such gentle behaviour, such civil discourses, such no|ble actions, such discreet entertainments, such cautionarie recreations; o|therwise they are bold, impudent, rude, flanting, ranting, romping wo|men: also Chastity in men makes them heroick, for propriety, justice con|stancy, and natural and honest love is the basis, pillars, or foundation where|on true valour is built, when amorous affections make men effeminate, cau|sing them to cast away their hard iron arms to lie in the soft arms of beau|ty, and stops their cares from loud alarums, with charming notes of Musick, it takes them from being masters of themselves, and others, and makes them become servants, and slaves; from commanding an Army to be com|manded by single women, by whom he is checkt like a school-boy, lead like a dog in a string, as after his mistrisses humours, her frowns make him crouch like a cur, her smiles make him skip, and make face like a Jack a●|apes, and their beastly appetites make them so rude, and wilde, as they re|gard no civility of behaviour, no gentleness of disposition, no constancy of affection, they keep no friendship, constancy, or vowes, they break all de|cent customs, and disobey all honest laws; but this is a theam too wilde to be preacht on.</p>

                     <p>Truly all three, as Beauty, Youth, or the Lady <hi>Procurer,</hi> rather than perswade me, would divert me, had I a wanton nature; as first, for the Lady <hi>Procurer</hi> her baseness appeared such as made me hate my self for being of the same sex she was of, and grieved me to see the follies of mankind, the one appearing like a Devil, the other like a beast, so seem'd the Lover and the Bawd, when men have Reason to govern, as much as Appetite to per|swade, the one proceeding from the Soul, the other from the body; besides, Virtue is the Natural Complexion of the Soul, not Vice: for Vice is bred, not born in man: As for Youth, it is so fantastical, extravagant, wilde, and self-opinionated, doing such ridiculous Actions, putting themselves into such affected Postures, as I might be as soon enamour'd with a Jack-anapes: Be|sides, the discourses of Youth are so flashy, as it gives the hearers no relish; and their Judgment is so shallow, and their Understanding so mysty, as when Reason discourses with them, it is apt to be lost in the darkness of Ignorance. Lastly, for Beauty in men, it is worse than unhansomeness in women: for an ill-favour'd woman seems masculine, as if she had an Heroick Spirit,
<pb n="452" facs="238"/>
though she were a Coward; to have a judicious Understanding, though she should be a Fool; to be Chaste, although she were Wanton; when on the contrary, a beautiful man appears Effeminate, Foolish, and Cowardly, when (perchance) he may be Wise and Valiant, yet 'tis Beauty makes him seem otherwise; and (for the most part) a beautiful man is more nice and curious about his person, as in his cloathing, dressing, trimming, perfuming, powde|ring, curling, and some will pomate and paine themselves, all which seems to me preposterous to men, insomuch as I could as soon be amorously affe|cted with my own Sex, as those that are accounted beautiful men; and you might sooner be jealous of Age than Youth, with a Sun-burnt face and a wi|ther'd skin, than a face that looks as if it had not seen the Sun, or the Sun it, nor felt the nipping Frost nor parching Wind; but I hope you have a better opinion of your self than to be jealous, as to think I can like any man better, or so well as you: And if you have not so good an opinion of me, us to believe I am constantly honest, yet I have such an assurance of my self, as to know I am not liable to be corrupted, and I am so Chaste, as I have not a thought subject to fully the purity of my chaste Mind and honest Heart.</p>

                     <speaker>Courtly.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes; and its part of the Wifes duty which she owes to her Hus|band, to be content.</p>

                     <speaker>Courtly.</speaker>
                     <p>She is bound to obey all duties: for the fundamental Laws in Mariage, are for the Husband to rule, the Wife to obey; the Husband to cherish, the VVife to love; the Husband to be Valiant to defend and protect her, the VVife to be Chaste, to suffer and submit; and when I leave to Com|mand, you may leave for to Obey; when I leave to Cherish, you may leave to Love; when I am a Coward, you may be a VVhore: for when I base|ly part with my Honour, you are not bound to keep it; but until I do part with my Honour, I charge you to keep it as you would do your life.</p>

                     <p>Yes, to the Sex, but not to his VVife, in the case of Amorous Im|bracements: for a Husband hath liberty for variety, but the VVife is re|frain'd to one.</p>

                     <p>My poor Lady sits so melancholy, and sighs and weeps, as it grieves my Soul to see her.</p>

                     <p>Can you blame her, when she and her children must go a beg|ging, or sit and starve: for my Master hath sold most of his Estate at several times, and hath spent the money in Drink and VVhores, and hath lost it at play: and now he hath sent for all his Plate to play away, her Jewels were pawn'd before.</p>

                     <p>Then she must get some acquaintance, and turn Lady Bawd, and shew Ladies how to dress themselves, and sell paint, pomatoms, wax-gloves, oyl'd-masks, and the like Commodities privately; or else she must pretend Skill in Chirurgery or Physick, and to make Plaisters, Salves, Oyntments, and the like, or make Cordial Powders, or Cordial Waters, and other wa|ters and powders; then perswade old Ladies to take thereof, telling them those will make them look as young as one of fifteen.</p>

                     <p>No 'faith, there requires not much charge: for Paint, Poma|tom, and the like Commodities, will sell at any price, and will be made at a little charge: and for Salves and Plaisters, and Oyls and Oyntments, Hogs|grease, Turpentine, and Bole-Armonike, serves for all sorts of those things, and Bread, and Meal, and Milk, and some chopt Herbs, and Sallet-oyl, serves for all Pultesses; and for Cordial Powders, some hot Seeds, as Anniseed, Caroway-seed, Coriander-seed, and the like Seeds, with some powder of Liquoras, and beaten Spices, with some sorts of Gums, as Mastick, Myrrh, and the like, will serve their turn.</p>

                     <p>'Faith a little powder of posts serves as well: for they cannot be distinguish'd by their taste; but howsoever, it is but putting a grain of Musk and Ambergrease, and instead of Amber, Coral, and Pearl, 'tis but poudring some shav'd Harts-horn and Chiny, and they will serve as well, and (per|chance work as good Effects:) Indeed Cordial Waters are chargeable to
<pb n="455" facs="239"/>
make: for they require fire to distill them; but there is some remedy for that: for it is but buying several sorts of ordinary hot waters, and mix them together, so as no one of the waters may predominate in taste, and it will pass for rare extracted Spirits, so as she shall never need to venture to distill, or lay out money, but just for the present to fetch it from those that sell <hi>Aqua|vitae, Rosasolus,</hi> and the like, which may be had at a cheap rate, and she may sell them at a great price.</p>

                     <p>VVhat if I am? Mariage is lawful.</p>

                     <speaker>Sprightly.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes Sir, but I doubt whether it be honourable or not: for 'tis said you are maried to my Chamber-maid <hi>Dol Subtilty.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <speaker>Widower.</speaker>
                     <p>Perchance I am.</p>

                     <speaker>Sprightly.</speaker>
                     <p>Then I desire your Lordship will let me marry too.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Widower.</speaker>
                     <p>VVith all my heart, and I shall do my part towards thy mari|age; but to whom would you be maried?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sprightly.</speaker>
                     <p>Your Butler Sir.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Widower.</speaker>
                     <p>Out upon thee base Girl, would you marry a Tapster?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sprightly.</speaker>
                     <p>Why Sir, a Tapster is as good as a piss-pot emptier; besides, they say you have done the fellow wrong: for she (they say) was his by pro|mise, and if Conscience hath right, he ought to have her; and perhaps, did not Ambition come in the way, Affection might prevail: wherefore to gra|tifie him, you ought in justice to bestow me upon him.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Widower.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, because you shall not marry my Butler, I will not marry your Maid: for the truth is, I never had so low a thought. But let me tell you, it is in the way of disobedience to question a Fathers Actions, and a presumption for a Child to think their Father is not wise enough to govern himself; besides, Children were ingrateful to Parents, to desire that from them, which they cannot, or will not keep to themselves, as neither to suffer a Father to marry, or keep a Mistress: Do Children think a Father is bound to so many Children, and no more?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sprightly.</speaker>
                     <p>Sir, I dare answer for the part of Children, that they would be well content that their Father should have Mistrisses, but they would be un|willing and griev'd that their Fathers should be their Mistrisses slave, where|by they incaptivate their Children, or ruine their Estates.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Widower.</speaker>
                     <p>Well then inquire no more after any Mistris I shall have, un|til you are incaptivated.</p>
