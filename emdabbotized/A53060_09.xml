                     <p>If she surpasseth their Appetites, as you say she doth their Beauties, she may chance to fire this City with flames of Love, or cause a War to destroy it.</p>

                     <p>But there is more probability that she hath a surpassing beauty if a woman praise her, than if a man had praised her: for men have a partial love to the Effeminate Sex, which multiplies their beauties to their sight, and makes a candle in the night seem like a Blazing Star.</p>

                     <p>But Envy is quick-sighted, and therefore I am afraid the Lady you speak of is surpassing, since those of her own Sex can find no blemish or imperfection to cloud her from a praise.</p>

                     <p>Why then let us go to that Church which is most frequented, as where some Famous Preachers preach; and certainly, if she be such a Beau|ty, she will be there: Besides, there our Sex sit to the full View, to Attract the Eyes of the Gods.</p>

                     <p>No, no, Lady, they sit to the full View, to tempt the Appetites of men: for they think not on the Gods, nor care the Gods should think of them.</p>

                     <p>Fie, fie, <hi>Mother Matron,</hi> you will make Women damnable crea|tures, if they could be made so by your Description: But Women go to Church to present their prayers of Request, and praises of Thanksgiving, and not to shew themselves to men, nor to tempt their Appetites, as you say.</p>

                     <p>If <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Caesar</hi> must have been old before they possibly could have been conquer'd, it proves that women do rather conquer Age, than power weakens the strength; and the truth is, women conquer no|thing but the vices, weaknesses, and defects of men: As they can conquer an unexperienc'd Youth, and doting Age, ignorant Breeding, effeminate Natures, wavering Minds, facile Dispositions, soft Passions, wanton Thoughts, unruly Appetites, and the luxurious Lives of men; but they cannot conquer mens fix'd Resolutions, their heroick Valours, their high Ambitions, their magnificent Generosities, their glorious Honours, or their conquering or over-ruling Powers: Nor can women conquer their moral Vertues, as their Prudence, Fortitude, Justice, and Temperance. But put the case a man had the power of the whole World, and could quit that power for the enjoy|ment of any particular woman, or women, yet he quits not that power for the womans sake, but for his minds-sake, his pleasure-sake, as to satisfie his Fancy, Passion, or Appetites: And what Conpuest soever Women make on Men, if any Conquest they do make, is more by the favour of Nature, than the Gods.</p>

                     <p>Why <hi>Mother Matron</hi> had a spic'd pot of Ale in her hand, so she set it to her mouth, and drank a hearty draught of it, and finding it very good and refreshing, drank another draught. By my faith, said she, this is a cheer|ly cup indeed, and a comfortable drink, and with that drank another draught, and so long-winded she was, as she drank up all the Ale therein: Where|upon, <hi>Grave Temperance</hi> rebuked her for drinking so much, saying, that though a little, as one draught, or so, might refresh the Spirits, yet a great quantity would make her drunk: Whereupon <hi>Mother Matron,</hi> who could not then suffer a reproof, in anger she flung the pot, which was still in her hand, at <hi>Grave Temperance</hi>'s head.</p>

Ladies that love the World better than Heaven, and hate a Nunnery worse than Death; and by my Faith they have reason, for liberty is the joy of life, and the World is the place of sensual pleasures, and sensual pleasures are substantial, and in being, when the pleasures aftee death are uncertain; but if they were certain, yet I had rather have a draught of Ale in this World, than a draught of Nectar in the next.</p>

                     <p>In a pardon all faults ought to be forgiven, if not forgotten, and no repetitions ought to be made of the same: for a clear pardon, and a free forgiveness, blots out all offences, or should do so. But you imagine your offences greater than they are, and by your doubts, I to be of less good nature than I am.</p>

                     <p>But if Women would Preach of the parts of the Body, and leave Preaching of the Spirit and Soul, it would be better for themselves, their Husbands, Friends, and Neighbours, than it is: And if men would do the like, it would be better for themselves, their wives, and neighbours: But they preach altogether of the Soul, and yet know not what the Soul is.</p>

                     <speaker>Pleasure.</speaker>
                     <p>How would you have them preach of the Body?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tranquill.</speaker>
                     <p>First, as for themselves, if they would consider: for they must consider before they Preach, which is, to Teach: If they would consider, I say, how frail the parts of Mankind are, how tender and weak every part of the body is, how apt they are to sickness &amp; diseases, how they are subject more to pain than to pleasure, how difficult it is to keep the body from harm, how soon the body withers, decays, and dies: If Mankind did consider this of the body, they would study what was the guard, and the preservation of every part of the body; in which study they would find Temperance the only preser|vation of parts, and life of pleasure: for in Excess pleasure dies, and pains possess the body. Thus we can destroy the body sooner by Excess, and pre|serve it longer by Temperance, than otherwise it would be.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, for those that are maried, temperance keeps both man and wise chaste, patient, and healthful, because gluttony, debauchery, and intemperate anger, hurts the body, and destroys the body. Thus temperance keeps the place of Wedlock: for a Wife being patient, the Husband lives peaceably, being chaste, he lives honourably, being healthful, he lives comfortably; and the Husband, being temperate, he will neither be a Glutton, a Drunkard, an Adulterer, nor Gamester: for gaming hurts the body, with vexing at the losses, and sitting still, which hinders the Exercise of the body, or keeping unseasonable hours, which is pernicious to the health of the Body, as to the quiet of the Mind, and waste of their Estates. Thus a man and wife lives free from jealousies and fear of poverty</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="300" facs="162"/>Thirdly, for their Neighbours: If they be temperate, they will neither be covetous, quarrelsome, nor envious, which will keep them from doing injury or wrong, and will cause them to be friendly and kind: for if they covet not their neighbours goods, they will not strive to possess their neighbours right; if they be not envious, they will be sociable, and helpful to each other, as good neighbours ought to be: thus they will not vex each other with Law|sutes, and quarrelling Disputes, nor Adulteries, and the like: And if men live peaceably, it is good for the Common-wealth, as being free from faction and tumult: Besides, Peace and Love are the ground whereon all the Com|mands of the Gods are built on.</p>

                     <speaker>Ambition.</speaker>
                     <p>As in Contemplation, for I could enjoy his Soul no otherwise, if I were maried to him: for if I were maried, I could but contemplate of his Merits, please my self with the thoughts of his Virtues, honour his gene|rous Nature, and praise his Heroick Actions: And these I can do as much, although I should live at distance from him, nor never be his Wife: for the mariage of Bodies, is no enjoyment of Souls.</p>

                     <speaker>Inquisitive.</speaker>
                     <p>This would only be an opinion of delight, but no true enjoy|ment of pleasure: for though an Opinion may affright the Soul, yet the O|pinion cannot pleasure the Body. But say an Opinion could delight the Soul without the Senses, yet the pleasures of the Senses are to be preferred before the delight of the Soul: for the truth is, that the spirits of life take more de|light in sensual pleasures, than in the Souls imagination: for life lives in the Senses, not in the Soul: for were there no Senses, there would be no Life.</p>

                     <speaker>Satyrical.</speaker>

                     <p>No: for they joy in the thought of your torments, and their general prayers are to <hi>Cupid,</hi> imploring him to wound you with a golden-headed Arrow, and she you love, with an Arrow headed with lead: As for their particular prayers, they are after this manner.</p>
                     <p>One prays you may sigh your self into Air, and the Air so infectious, as it may plague all the Satyrical of your Sex.</p>
                     <p>Another prayeth you may weep tears of Vitriol, and that the sharpness of those tears may corrode your soul.</p>
                     <p>Another prays that your passion of love may be so hot, as it may torment you, as Hell-fire doth the damned; but <hi>Mother Matron,</hi> besides saying <hi>A|men</hi> to all their prayers, makes her prayers thus, That she for whose sake you must endure all these torments, may be the oldest, and most ill-favour'd de|form'd woman that ever Nature, Accident, and Time made.</p>

                     <p>Faith she's as bad as dead to me, and worse than if she were maried: for if she were a Wife, there would be some hopes; but her careful Father hath carry'd her away into the Country, being jealous of the much company that came to visit her.</p>

                     <p>It is a sign, <hi>Temperance,</hi> your beauty is past: for would you have an extraordinary Beauty to be buried in oblivion?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Temperance.</speaker>
                     <p>Because what is common, is never highly priz'd, but rather despis'd, or at least neglected by continuance: for that which is at first ad|mir'd as a wonder, when it comes to be as domestick, is not regarded: for it is an old saying, That the greatest wonder lasts but nine days.</p>

                     <speaker>Portrait.</speaker>
                     <p>But there is such a sympathy betwixt beauty and sight, that as long as beauty doth last, sight will take delight to look thereon; and the De|sign, End, or Fruition of Beauty, is to be gaz'd upon: for from the sight it receives Praise, Love, and Desire, and by reflection sets all hearts on fire.</p>

                     <p>O that I had such a Beauty as would burn every Masculine heart into cinders!</p>

                     <speaker>Temperance.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Faction.</speaker>
                     <p>My wish proceeds out of love to my self, and mercy to men. First, out of love to my self: for as I am a woman, I naturally desire Beau|ty, and there is no woman that had not rather have beauty, although atten|ded with an unfortunate life, than be ill-savour'd, to enjoy prosperity.</p>
                     <p>The last wish is out of mercy to men: for their hearts are so false and foul, as no way but burning can purifie them.</p>

                     <p>For my part, if it were in my power to choose, I would rather have Wit than Beauty: for Wit pleaseth the Ear, both longer and more, than Beauty pleaseth the Sight, and the sound of the one, spreads farther
<pb n="312" facs="168"/>
than the sight of the other: Besides, Wit recreate● the Mind, and entertains the Reason, Beauty only the Sense, and but one sense, as the sight, when Wit is a companion not only to the sense of Hearing, but the soul of Understand|ing; and it is not only a delightful Companion, but a subtil Observer, an ingenious Inventer, an excellent Artificer, a politick Counsellour, a power|ful Commander, a prudent Ruler, and a divine Creator; it observes all natures works; it invents all useful Arts, it frames all Common-wealths, it guides the Senses, rules the Appetites, commands the Passions, counsels the Thoughts, re|gulates the Opinions, creates the Conceptions, Imaginations, and Fancies; it builds Potiecal Castles, and makes Gardens of Rhetorick, and makes the sound Harmonical, playing with words, as on musical Instruments: Besides, Wit continues to old Age, when Beauty vades in a year or two.</p>

                     <p>Come, come, <hi>Temperance,</hi> if you were young, you would prefer Beauty before a Wit, by which you might get more pleasure by the one, than profit by the other: But all our Sex, when they grow in years, desire to be thought Wits, when they can no longer be thought Beauties, which makes them dispute for Wit, and dispraise Beauty, by undervaluing it.</p>

Thus wash'd, cleans'd, and refresh'd, you will be fit to enter into the Palace of Fame.</p>

                     <speaker>Frisk.</speaker>
                     <p>My fair Maid, what Message have you brought me now?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maid.</speaker>
                     <p>My Mistris remembers her loving love unto you, and bids me tell you, that she takes it wondrous unkindly that you shew'd the young La|dies the Letter, and that she heard you mock'd and jeer'd at her.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Frisk.</speaker>
                     <p>Tell her I did but as all Lovers use to do, vaunt of their Mistris's love, and boast of their Mistris's favours.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maid.</speaker>
                     <p>She doth not like your boasting; but howsoever, to shew and ex|press her constant love and affectionate heart, she hath sent you two hun|dred pounds to buy you a Nag.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Frisk.</speaker>
                     <p>I accept of the Present, and tell her I will ride the Nag for her sake.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maid.</speaker>
                     <p>My Mistris will be a joy'd Woman, to hear that you will ride for her sake.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Frisk.</speaker>
                     <p>But is thy Mistris rich?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maid.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes by my truth is she; for she hath store of bags in her Chests.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Frisk.</speaker>
                     <p>But are they full of gold and silver?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maid.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes: for I have seen her tell the money in the bags, bag after bag.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Frisk.</speaker>
                     <p>Is it all her own?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maid.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes certainly it is all her own.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Frisk.</speaker>
                     <p>How came she to be so rich?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maid.</speaker>
                     <p>Why the young Ladies Parents give her money or moneys worth to Govern and Educate their Daughters, and the young Ladies bribe her to keep their counsels, and fee her to be their Agent, and their Courtly Servants present her with rich gifts to prefer their Sutes, and to speak in their behalfs to the young Ladies; and thus she gains on every side, and takes gifts on both hands, and she being miserable and sparing, must needs be rich; but now she is become a Lover, she begins to grow prodigal, as all Lovers are; but if she had a million, she says, nay swears, she could bestow it all on her beloved, which beloved is your Worship.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Frisk.</speaker>
                     <p>I could be well content to marry her wealth, and lie with her Maid, but I would not be troubled with the Mistris.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maid.</speaker>
                     <p>My Mistris, I believe, will be a very fond Wife.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Frisk.</speaker>
                     <p>And that fondness is the second obstacle I stick at: for first to be old, and then to be fond, will be a double misery, as being an intolerable trouble, and a nauseous vexation; for there is nothing more hateful, than an amorous fond old woman: But if thou wilt be fond of me, I shall like it well; and if any thing could perswade me to marry thy Mistris, next to her wealth, will be in hopes of thy kindness. What say you, will you be kind?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Maid.</speaker>
                     <p>I shall not be undutiful: when you are my Master, I shall deny no service I can do your Worship.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Frisk.</speaker>
                     <p>That's well promis'd: In the mean time remember me to thy Mi|stris, and thank her for her Present, and tell her, the more such Presents she sends, the welcomer they shall be.</p>

                     <p>Madamoiselle, you may do a charitable Act.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sensuality.</speaker>
                     <p>As to marry me.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Portrait.</speaker>
                     <p>If it be a Charity to you, it would be none to my self, but the contrary: I should prove cruel to my self, in making my life unhappy.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sensuality.</speaker>
                     <p>Yet it will be a meritorious Act: for what is more meritori|ous than to save a soul?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Portrait.</speaker>
                     <p>So I shall rob <hi>Pluto</hi> of his due and just right.</p>

                     <speaker>Sensuality.</speaker>
                     <p>He will never miss his loss: for on my Conscience he is not so good an Arithmetician, as he could count and number the Millions of souls he hath in Hell, or those he hath right to; nay, if he had the skill of <hi>Utlick,</hi> he could not number them, for they surmount all Accounts.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Portrait.</speaker>
                     <p>But the torments he puts souls, to will ●ind them out.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sensuality.</speaker>
                     <p>It is a question whether souls are capable of torments; but howsoever; to put it out of question, pray marry me: for I am become of a sudden very consentious.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Portrait.</speaker>
                     <p>But there will be another question, which is, Whether Mariage will save you, or not?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sensuality.</speaker>
                     <p>O yes: for the Purgatory of Mariage doth purifie Souls, and make them fit for Heaven.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Portrait.</speaker>
                     <p>But I fear, if I should marry you, I should do like those that strive to save a drowning man; so I, indeavouring to save you, should lose my self.</p>

                     <speaker>Superbe.</speaker>
                     <p>By reason healthful temperance never gives such surfetting coun|sel: for there are as many of us as might be marying a year, and keeping their Festivals, and you would have all marry'd in one day.</p>

                     <p>Madam <hi>Temperance</hi> means, she would have a whole year as one Wedding-day</p>

                     <speaker>Heroick.</speaker>
                     <p>And one Wedding-day to the Bride and Bridegroom, is as one whole year.</p>

                     <p>Not to every Bride and Bridegroom: for on my Conscience Monsieur <hi>Frisk,</hi> if he should marry <hi>Mother Matron,</hi> will think his Wedding-day but a minute long.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>I hear that <hi>Wits Cabal</hi> is removing out of <hi>Cupids</hi> Court into <hi>Hymens</hi> prison, and there to be bound in bonds of Matrimony.</p>
                  </sp>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>Faith I pity the <hi>Cabal,</hi> and condemn their Wit, by reason it did not keep them out of slavery.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>1 <hi>Gentle.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>Wit is both a Pander and a Traitor: for Wit is a Pimp in <hi>Cu|pids</hi> Court, and betrays his Court to <hi>Hymens</hi> Prison.</p>

                     <speaker>1 <hi>Gentle.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>There is great reason for it: for they are almost starv'd for want of variety, and they have less liberty than other prisoners have.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>You hear of the great Mariages that are concluded on, and they are to be dispatch'd out of hand.</p>

                     <p>Hear of them (say you) I must stop my Ears, and shut my Eyes, if I did not both hear and see their preparations: for all the Tradesmen are so busily imploy'd, as if they were never to sell or work more after these Ma|riages.</p>

                     <p>Why Taylors, Shoomakers, Hosiers, Seamstresses, Feather-men, Periwig-makers, Perfumers, Clothiers, Linnengers, Silk men, Mercers, Mil|leners, Haberdashers, Curlers, Spurriers, Sadlers, Coach-makers, Uphol|storers, besides Confectioners, Cooks, Bakers, Brewers, Butchers, Poulterers, and twenty more I cannot think of.</p>

                     <p>They will kill and destroy so many creatures for their Feasts, that they will make a massacre.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>But there will be great dancings at the Court they say: for three will be Masks, Plays, Balls, and such braveries as never was.</p>

                     <p>These publick Weddings, and such publick Revellings, put the Gentry to more charges, than many times they are able to spare; which if it were not for Revelling, there would be no need of such vain and idle Ex|pences.</p>

                     <p>If my Mistris agree, we will keep ours at the Play-house, and feast and dance upon the Stage.</p>

                     <p>An Ordinary, or Tavern, is a more commodious place for the Society of the Wits: for I am sure all the Wits will meet there.</p>

                     <speaker>Satyrical.</speaker>
                     <p>But if an Ordinary, or Tavern, be more commodious, yet they are not so publick places as the Theaters of Players; so that Wits may be merrier and freer in a Tavern, but not so divulged as on a Stage in a Play-House.</p>

                     <p>The truth is, an Ordinary or Tavern is a more proper place for Monsieur <hi>Sensuality</hi> and his Mistris to keep their Wedding-Feast, than for Monsieur <hi>Satyrical</hi> and his Mistris.</p>
