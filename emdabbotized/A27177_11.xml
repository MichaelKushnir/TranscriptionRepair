                                 <l>Before the laſt Dukes death, whoſe honour'd bones</l>
                                 <l>Now reſt in peace) this yong Prince had the ordering,</l>
                                 <l>(To Crowne his fathers hopes) of all the Army:</l>
                                 <l>Who (to be ſhort) put all his power to practiſe;</l>
                                 <l>Faſhion'd, and drew 'em up: but alas, ſo poorely</l>
                                 <l>So raggedly and looſely, ſo unſouldier'd,</l>
                                 <l>The good Duke bluſh'd, and call'd unto my father,</l>
                                 <l>Who then was Generall: Goe <hi>Archus</hi> ſpeedily,</l>
                                 <l>And chide the Boy, before the ſouldier finde him,</l>
                                 <l>Stand thou between his ignorance and them,</l>
                                 <l>Faſhion their bodies new to thy direction;</l>

                                 <l>My Sire obey'd, and did ſo; with all duty</l>
                                 <l>Inform'd the Prince, and read him all directions:</l>
                                 <l>This bred diſtaſte, diſtaſte grew up to anger,</l>
                                 <l>And anger into wilde words broke out thus:</l>
                                 <l>Well <hi>Archus,</hi> if I live but to command here,</l>
                                 <l>To be but Duke once, I ſhall then remember,</l>

                                 <l>To which my Father anſwer'd (ſomewhat mov'd too)</l>
                                 <l>And with a vow he ſeal'd it: Royall ſir,</l>
                                 <l>Since for my faith and fights, your Icorne and anger</l>
                                 <l>Onely purſue me; if I live to that day,</l>
                                 <l>That day ſo long expected to reward me,</l>
                                 <l>By his ſo ever noble hand you ſwore by,</l>
                                 <l>And by the hand of Juſtice, never Armes more</l>
                                 <l>Shall rib this body in, nor ſword hang here, ſir:</l>

                                 <l>Shall be repentant prayers. So they parted.</l>
