TRAGEDIE OF THE MOST GRAVE

               <head>To the Reader.</head>
               <p>_ALTHOVGH (GENTLE
Reader) thou mayſt perhaps thinke
mee arrogant, for that I onely a|mong
ſo many fine wittes and to|wardly
youth (with which Englād
this day floriſheth) haue enterpriſed
to ſet forth in engliſh this preſent
piece of the flowre of all writers,
Seneca, as who ſay, not fearing what grauer heads might
iudge of me, in attempting ſo hard a thing, yet vpon well
pondering what next enſueth, I truſt both thy ſelfe ſhalt
cleare thine owne ſuſpicion, and thy chaunged opinion ſhal
iudge of me more rightfull ſentence. For neither haue I
taken this worke firſt in hand, as once entending it ſhould
come to light (of well doynge wherof I vtterly diſpayred)
and beynge done but for myne owne priuate exerciſe, I
am in myne opinion herein blameles, thoughe I haue
(to proue my ſelfe) priuately taken the part which pleaſed
me beſt of ſo excellent an author, for better is tyme ſpent
in the beſt then other, and at firſt to attempt the hardeſt
writers, ſhall make a mā more prompt to tranſlate the ea|ſier
with more facility. But now ſince by requeſt, &amp; frēd|ſhip
of thoſe, to whom I could denye nothinge, this worke
agaynſt my will extorted is out of my hands, I needes muſt
<pb facs="102"/>●raue thy pacience in reading, and facility of iudgement:
when thou shalt apparantly ſe my witles lacke of learning,
prayng thee to conſider how hard a thing it is for mee to
touch at ful in all poynts the authors mynd, (beyng in ma|ny
places verye harde and doubtfull, and the worke much
corrupt by the default of euil printed Bookes) and alſo how
farre aboue my power to keepe that Grace and maieſtye of
ſtile, that Seneca doth, when both ſo excellent a writer
hath paſt the reach of all imitation, and alſo this our En|glish
toung (as many thinke, and I here fynd) is farre vn|able
to compare with the Latten: but thou (good Reader)
if I in any place haue ſwerued from the true ſence, or not
kept the roialty of ſpeach, meete for a Tragedie, impute the
one to my youth and lacke of iudgement: the other to my
lacke of Eloquence. Now as concerninge ſondrye places
augmented and ſome altered in this my tranſlation. Firſt
for aſmuch as this worke ſeemed vnto mee in ſome places
vnperfite, whether left ſo of the Author, or parte of it
loſte, as tyme deuoureth all thinges, I wot not, I haue
(where I thought good) with addition of myne owne
Penne ſupplied the wante of ſome thynges, as the firste
Chorus, after the first acte begynninge thus. O ye to whom
&amp;c. Alſo in the ſeconde Acte I haue added the ſpeache
of Achilles Spright, ryſyng from Hell to require the Sa|crifyce
of Polyxena begynning in this wyſe. Forſakinge
now. &amp;c. Agayne the three laste ſtaues of the Chorus
after the ſame Acte: and as for the thyrde Chorus
which in Seneca beginneth thus, QVE VOCAT SE|DES?
For asmuch as nothing is therein but a heaped
number of farre and ſtraunge Countries, conſiderynge
with my ſelfe, that the names of ſo manye vnknowen
<pb n="96" facs="102"/>
Countreyes, Mountaynes, Deſertes, and VVoodes,
ſhoulde haue no grace in the Engliſhe tounge, but bee a
ſtraunge and vnpleaſant thinge to the Readers (excepte
I should expound the Historyes of each one, which would
be farre to tedious,) I haue in the place therof made ano|ther
beginninge, in this manner. O Ioue that leadst. &amp;c.
VVhich alteration may be borne withall, ſeynge that Cho|rus
is no part of the ſubſtaunce of the matter. In the reſt
I haue for my ſlender learninge endeuored to keepe touch
with the Latten, not worde for woorde or verſe for verſe,
as to expounde it, but neglectynge the placinge of the
wordes, obſerued their ſence. Take Gentle Reader this
in good woorth with all his faultes, fauour my first be|ginninges,
and amende rather with good will ſuch things
as herein are amiſſe, then to depraue or diſcommende my
labour and paynes, for the faultes, ſeyng that I haue
herein, but onelye made waye to other that
canne farre better doe this or like, deſi|ryng
them that as they can, ſo
they would. Farewel gen|tle
Reader and ac|cept
my good
will.</p>
