Oh! that I had been that day with the brave <hi>Facertes,</hi> who knows but I might have digg'd a glorious Monument in some lucky wound, given in the face of this admir'd <hi>Virgilius,</hi> and after such a Fortune, I could have smil'd, and, unshook, step'd into my graye. Or if slav'd, such bold truths I would have utter'd, they should not have de|stroy'd me for cold Example, but rather because <hi>Rome</hi> durst not let me live. And yet I beg if there be any Power favourable to <hi>Cilius,</hi> let it set within my swords reach this <hi>Virgilius,</hi> this King of Men, This <hi>Sicilian</hi> scourge, that makes us kneel and kiss our Afflictions; Then, then, <hi>Teresius,</hi> thou shalt see, how with this sword Ile hunt his pale Soul to her last home.</p>

                        <p>O Let me stretch my self, and thus enlarg'd possess my Joyes; for know, my longing Soul made a Crown a Burthen, and with greater joy I have put off an Empire, then thou thy chaines; and now transported with my hopes, the Bird that from the Cage is flown, and broke that Prison, where she was wont to mourn, and sings all Tunes at once, That Bird, I say, cuts not the yielding Air with more joyful Freedom, then I, to find my self, and deliver'd from that imprisoning state.</p>

                        <p>Sir, That you are alone makes you not less in my esteem; for it is not your power I admire, (the loss of mine own tells me, that's mortal) but your Mind; which, when <hi>Virgilius</hi> is nothing but what my Memory gives life to, will make me wor|ship his Monument.</p>

                        <p>No more, Prince <hi>Facertes,</hi> my Friend, and to confirm him take a secret, by which Ile bind him to me for ever; for se|crets have stronger ties then Love, or Vowes; for whilst thou hast Honour that binds thee, the other may by mistake or Passion (which Friendship's self is subject to) fall even to hate.</p>

                        <p>She is all my hopes, all my wishes, and all my fears; and if she smile, I am fortunate: for know, my journey is to lay at her feet my self, and all that Conquest gave me. What thinks <hi>Facer|tes?</hi> will she accept it, and not destroy the destroyer? For no|thing can be conquest, where she suffer'd, but height of Murther.</p>

                        <p>Your friendship I shall never decline; and if <hi>Sophia</hi> be just, you have a warrant for you faith of mine. When I went for <hi>Gallia</hi> to take command of those Legions there, at parting, we fell into discourse of you, and the never-enough-admir'd <hi>Cicilia,</hi> whose beauties and vertues she always mention'd with admiration: I confessed to her, that her former descriptions had engaged my af|fections to your Sisters fame so much, that I was resolved, in some disguise, to see her. O're-joyed with this news, she recommended you to me for a guide, And though I ever admir'd the honour I found in <hi>Facertes,</hi> yet I confess, I made a little stop ere I resolved to put my self in the power of one, whom I had tempted with such a ruine, as obeying my Fathers injunctions, had made me lay upon your suffering Country; to remove which doubt she blushed out this secret; I ask'd her then, why she suffer'd thee to be led in triumph? she said, she pleaded against it, what she durst, and had she loved less, she could have said more, but seeing her own guilt, she fear'd it might have been trouble to all: Now if this truth can satisfie <hi>Facertes,</hi> that I have not wrong'd him, and now I beg, he'l give me leave to return his vows, to <hi>Cicilia;</hi> and now I conjure thee by that power which thou hast given her, in <hi>Sophia</hi>'s name, here to bury all thy fears, all thy anger, all remembrance that I was a misfortune to thee, in return of which upon thy breast, the
<pb n="13" facs="9"/>
Altar of friendship, I'll lay mine a sacrifice, and vow my self to fair <hi>Cicilia,</hi> and her Country, a constant friend.</p>

                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Facert.</speaker>
                        <p>Yes, it was about a slave he saw, and fell in love with; and while he stay'd for money to redeem her, another bought her; I was not at the beginning, but, I thank my fate, I came time e|nough to his Rescue.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Facert.</speaker>
                        <p>Yes, Madam, but so impatient, for fear some violence should be offer'd to her, I am now going in search of her; for I know he'le find no Peace, till he has gain'd her freedom.</p>

                        <p>Yes, Madam, and now his soul labours in pain, to know what condition she is of; but I hope his flame is made of young mens fire, such as will not last.</p>

                        <speaker>Facert.</speaker>
                        <p>Because I have the honour to be his friend; and though I serve his passion, yet I should be loath to see him continue his Love for a Slave, that has nothing but miseries for his Honour to work upon.</p>

                        <p>Nothing, nothing; ye gods! whither am I falling? down, <stage>She stops and turns from him.</stage> down Woman; All the pleadings of my Sex be gone, I will not be a slave to my Passion.</p>

                        <speaker>Facert.</speaker>
                        <p>Nor will I be so rude as to press a Secret from you; yet your Brother, Madam, should not serve you more faithfully, nor more willingly, then I.</p>

                        <p>I must not, no, I will not; yet I durst tell you, but 'tis not like <hi>Cicilia,</hi> nor the Laws that she has ever followed.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Facert.</speaker>
                        <p>Madam, your name has given Laws, and <hi>Cicilia's</hi> Acts have ever stood Examples, as unquestioned as unimitable: and by your self, I beg this trust.</p>
                     </sp>

                        <speaker>Cicil.</speaker>
                        <p>Then, as you are a Souldier, take it, and protect it, (I know no guilt,) why should I fear? I was that slave he fought for; and I rejoyce, the man I honour is so favoured of the Gods.</p>

                        <p>O Madam, this is a blessing beyond my hopes; dare you trust me to discover who you are? I'le first sound whether his Love

                        <speaker>Cicil.</speaker>
                        <p>Sir, I have not said I love, nor will not, till I hear him say so first; I confess I hope he loves, and what that hope can be call'd I acknowledge.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Cicil.</speaker>
                        <p>Yes, and if my Ears abuse me not, this morning you call'd me sister.</p>

                        <speaker>Cicil.</speaker>
                        <p>Oh, my Brother, why did you hide your self from me? is it true you told of your self? are you in love? shall not I know your story, that I may rejoyce in your joys?</p>

                        <speaker>Facert.</speaker>
                        <p>Yes, and there is another truth which I durst not disco|ver till thy love warranted it me: But now know the man thou hated'st is the man thou lovest; for <hi>Virgilius</hi> is that Prince; but when thou hast made an acquaintance with him thou wilt confess thy ignorance only could hate him.</p>

Am not I this day sold a slave? do's not our Country still bleed; and whil'st we talk, the licens'd lust of the common Souldier add new crimes? Oh! my Brother, let me not have reason to repent that neerness, but learn to hate him; and while he is in our power take a brave revenge; that he would do something to redeem these faults is no Argument to prefer him be|fore your Country; and though it be gallant in him to love, yet in thee or me a low mean sin.</p>

                        <p>THe Captain has refused to give me the freedom of her I Love, but if the <hi>Lieutenant</hi> keep his word, I shall make him repent it at as sad a rate as I bear my misery; 'tis not Love, sure, that afflicts my Heart, for I have heard 'em say, That it is a soft and gentle Passion, which strokes and courts the Mind, and his <stage>Cilius <hi>lies down.</hi>
                           </stage> service perfect freedom, for Love is both the Famine and the Food, none of these chains afflicts them; I have seen Women and Boyes play with this Power: 'Tis the sport of Virgins, and yet their Hearts last Ages; Nay, they can be false too, and yet not lose one Grace, nor one Beautyfalls; Even the perjur'd Lovers weare their quiet Minds and fair Faces still, whil'st I pine and wither under these two dayes misery. I cannot eat nor sleep since I saw her, and my frinds are irksome to me, I love loanness, and hunt Corners, and prize a thought of being her slave, more then a Conquest over the world; Yet I stammer still, and cannot speak sence when my griefs would tell her, the story of what I ail. I have lost my Courage too of late; for, by all our Gods, I start and tremble when I see her; Nay, I am a Dog if I do not weep when I behold her; no Boy at School has his tears readier then I, I could weep like froward Children. This makes me mad, to find my self a|bandoned by all the Gods, whose ends I cannot guess, nor why they send me this new way to misery.</p>

Fool, thou hast mistaken me all this while, and would'st thou have been silent I had told thee; 'tis her Eyes that have wounded me, and my disease is Love, desperate Love; if I can judge of that strange Passions; for 'tis Love for her that dies for another; hast thou a remedy for such a wound in the Mind?</p>

                        <p>Love, is that your disease? I am glad 'tis no worse; by my troth, Sir, if you will starve with meat before you, I will bu|ry you, but I will never pity you; Love and Marriage are the only two mischiefs that belong to the Sex which I have not had, and therefore can onely prescribe you Wine and Women for a remedy.</p>

                        <p>Now. cannot I be angry with him though I bleed; Sir, I would fain serve you if I knew how. Can you tell what 'tis your Love would have? what does the blind Child cry for, would he lie with the Wench? by this hand I will fetch her to you once more, if I thought that would cure your disease.</p>
                        <p>No more as you are a Souldier, by your Honour no more; your Honesty in other things excuses your Ignorance in this; no more I say. Alone I will find my remedy; and this sword, as I said before, has a Cure for all my miseries; for he that dares die may defie the worst of Fates.</p>

                        <p>Oh!

'tis not kindly done to add such a pain to my misfortune; had you fall'n into the power of our sex, though sold to sin; like these, I could have dy'd sooner then have injur'd you so as to think you would-out live your honour; and when you are just to me, you will not believe I prize mine so little as to sell it for a sham'd life.</p>
