                  <l>Most puissant and most honourable King,</l>
                  <l>My royall master, <hi>Lewis</hi> the King of France,</l>
                  <l>Doth gréete your Highnes with vnfained loue,</l>
                  <l>Wishing your health, prosperitie, and rule,</l>
                  <l>And thus he saies by me. When was it séene,</l>
                  <l>That euer <hi>Lewis</hi> pretended hurt to England,</l>
                  <l>Either by close conspirators sent ouer,</l>
                  <l>To vndermine your state; or openly,</l>
                  <l>By taking armes, with purpose to inuade?</l>
                  <l>Nay when was it, that <hi>Lewis</hi> was euer heard,</l>
                  <l>So much as to detract from <hi>Edwards</hi> name?</l>
                  <l>But still hath done him all his due of spéech,</l>
                  <l>By blazing to the world his high deserts,</l>
                  <l>Of wisedome, valour, and his heroicke birth:</l>
                  <l>Whence is it then that <hi>Edward</hi> is incensoe,</l>
                  <l>To render hate for loue, for amitie sterne warre?</l>
                  <l>Not of himselfe we know: but by the meanes</l>
                  <l>Of some infectious counsell, that like mud,</l>
                  <l>Would spoyle the pure temper of his noble minde,</l>
                  <l>It is the Duke, and that pernicious rebell,</l>
                  <l>Earle of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> haue set abroach these warres,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb facs="49"/>
Who of themselues, vnable to procéede,</l>
                  <l>Would make your Grace the instrument of wrong,</l>
                  <l>And when you haue done what you can for them,</l>
                  <l>You shall be sure of nothing but of this,</l>
                  <l>Still to be doubled and dissembled with.</l>
                  <l>But if it might séeme gratious in your eye,</l>
                  <l>To cast off these despisde consederates,</l>
                  <l>Vnfit companions for so great a Prince,</l>
                  <l>And ioyne in league with <hi>Lewis</hi> my royall master,</l>
                  <l>Him shall you finde as willing as of power,</l>
                  <l>To doe your Grace all offices of loue:</l>
                  <l>And what commoditie may spring thereby,</l>
                  <l>To both the Realmes, your Grace is wise enough,</l>
                  <l>Without my rude suggestions to imagine,</l>
                  <l>Besides, much bloodshed for this present time,</l>
                  <l>Will be preuented when two such personages,</l>
                  <l>Shall méete together to shake hands in peace,</l>
                  <l>And not with shock of Launce and Curtelaxe,</l>
                  <l>That <hi>Lewis</hi> is willing, I am his substitute,</l>
                  <l>And he himselfe in person if you please,</l>
                  <l>Not farre from hence will signifie as much.</l>
