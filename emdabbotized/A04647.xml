I doubt, <hi>Apollo</hi> hath got thee to be his <hi>Ingle,</hi> that thou commest
not abroad, to v●s●t thine old friends: well, take heede of him; hee
may doe somewhat for his houshold seruants, or so; But for his Re|tayners,
I am sure, I haue knowne some of them, that haue followed
him, three, foure, fiue yeere together, scorning the world with their
bare heeles, &amp; at length bene g●ad for a shift, (though no cleane shift)
to lye a whole winter, in halfe a sheete, cursing <hi>Charles wayne,</hi> and
the rest ●f the starres intolerably. But <hi>(quis contra diuos?)</hi> well;
Sirha, sweete villayne, come and see me; but spend one minute in my
compa●y, and 'tis inough: I thinke I haue a world of good le●ts for
thee▪ oh sirha, I can shew thee two of the most perfect, rare, &amp; ab|solute
true <hi>Gulls,</hi> that euer thou saw'st, if thou wil● come. S'blood,
inuent some famous ●●morable lye, or other, to flap thy father in the

〈◊〉 could'st be no <hi>Poet</hi> else: any sciruy roguish excuse will serue;
say thou com●st but to fetch wooll for thine Inke-borne. And then too,
thy Father will say thy wits are a wooll-gathering. But it's no mat|ter;
the worse, the better. Any thing is good inough for the old man.
Sirha, how 〈◊〉 thy Father should see this now? what would he think●
of me? Well, (howeuer I write to thee) ● reuerence him in my soule,
for the generall good all <hi>Florence</hi> deliuers of him. <hi>Lorenzo,</hi> I
coniure thee (by what, let me see) by the depth of our loue, by all the

to me to <hi>Florence</hi> this day. Go to, you shall come, and let your

patience? Then will I be made an <hi>Eunuch,</hi> and learne to sing
Ballads. I doe not deny, but my father may haue as much pa|tience
as any other man; for hee vses to take phisicke, and oft
taking phisicke, makes a man a very patient creature. But,
Signior <hi>Prospero,</hi> had your swaggering <hi>Epistle</hi> here, arriued in
my fathers hands, at such an houre of his patience, (I meane,
when hee had tane phisicke) it is to bee doubted, whether I
should haue read <hi>sweete villaynt here.</hi> But, what? My wise
cousin; Nay then, Ile furnish our feast with one Gull more to|ward

you haue a leaden constitution, couze, although perhaps a little
inclining to that temper, &amp; so the more apt to melt with pittie,

which reflects as bright to the world as an old Ale-wiues pew|ter

hide such reall ornaments as these, and shadow their glorie as
a Millaners wife doth her wrought stomacher, with a smoakie
lawne or a blacke cipresse? Come, come, for shame doe not
wrong the qualitie of your desert in so poore a kind: but let the

'tis most diuine. Further, take it in the nature, in the true kinde
so, it makes an Antidote, that (had you taken the most de●dly

another, he cries <hi>souldier:</hi> and thus halfe a dosen of them, till
they had go▪ me within doores, where I no sooner came▪ but
out flies their rapiers and all bent agaynst my brest, they
swore some two or three hundreth oathes, and all to tell me I
was but a dead man, if I did not confesse where you were, and
how I was imployed, and about what, which when they
could not get out of me: (as Gods my iudge, they should haue
kild me first) they lockt me vp into a roome in the toppe of a
<pb facs="31"/>
house, where by great miracle (hauing a light hart) I slidde
downe by a bottome of packthread into the streete, and so
scapt: but ma●ster, thus much I can assure you, for I heard it
while I 〈◊〉 lockt vp: there were a great many merchants and
rich citizens wiues with them at a banquet, and your sonne
<hi>Signior Lorenzo▪</hi> has poynted one of them to meete anone at
one <hi>Cobs</hi> house, a waterbearers? that dwelles by the wall: now
there you shall be sure to take him: for fayle he will not.</p>
