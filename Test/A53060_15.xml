                     <l>That thou wilt keep me in thy memory;</l>
                     <l>And place my Name in the large brazen Tower,</l>
                     <l>That neither Spight, nor Time may it devour;</l>
                     <l>And write it plain, that every age may see,</l>
                     <l>My Names inscrib'd to live eternally:</l>
                     <l>Let not Malice obstruct my Wit with spight,</l>

                     <p>I divide my discourse into three parts, as namely Vanity, Vice, and Wickedness; Vanity lives in the Customs and Manners of men, and Wick|edness in the Souls of men, Vices in the Senses of men, as vain habits, evill appetites, and wicked passions; as for Vanity and Vice, they are commo|dities that are sold out of the Shops of Idleness; Vice is sold by wholesale, but Vanities are sold by retail; the Buyers of these Commodities are Youth, the Merchants, are evil Customs, and ill examples; the Masculine youth buyes more Vice than Vanity, and the Effeminate youth buyes more Va|nity than Vice; but they all buy, as salt as they can be sold; they will spare for not cost, and will give any prices, although it be their Healths, Lives, Fortunes, or Reputations; as for Wickedness, it is inlayed into the soul like as Mosaick work, and so close it is wrought therein, as it makes it ap|pear to be the soul it self; but evill Education and Custome, are the Artifi|cers of this work, and not natural Creation, or divine infusion, or inspira|tion, from whence the Soul proceeds, or is produced, for neither the Gods, nor Nature, is the Author of Wickedness; but Vanity, Vice, and Wick|edness, are soon catcht, and like the Plague, they infect all they come near, and Vanity, Vice, and Wickedness is soon learn'd, when Virtue, Goodness, and Piety, are hard Lessons; for though Divines and natural Philosophers, Preaches, and so teaches them, yet they are seldom understood; for if they were, the benefit would be known, and men would pious and virtuous be, for profits sake; for Common-wealths that are composed, and governed by Virtue, Religion, and good Life, they are so strongly united by honest love, as they become inpregnable against Forein Foes, or home factions, or
<pb n="510" facs="267"/>
temptations, so live in peace and plenty, which breeds both pleasure and delight; for life doth never truly injoy it self, but in rest, ease, and peace; but to conclude most Noble and Right Honourable, the Soul, Se‚óèse, and Education, should be plain with Truth, smooth with Virtue, and bright with Picty, or Zeal; that the Body may live Easily, the life Peaceably, and that the Soul may be blessed with Everlasting Glory.</p>

                     <p>Lord how idly you speak Cousin, as to think men might idly pass away their time, when Nature allows life no idle time; for all things are growing, or decaying, feeding life, or getting food for to nourish life, or bearing, or breeding for increase; and man which only by his shape exceeds all other Creatures in Reason, Knowledge, and Under|standing, and will you have him cast away these supreme gifts of Nature with idle time? would you have men follow the Sense only, like a Beast, and not to be guided by reason to some noble study, or profitable action? would you have them yield to their surfeting Appetites, and not indeavour to temper them? is Sickness less painfull than Health? is Disorder to be pre|fer'd before Method, or Inconveniency before Conveniency, Warrs before Peace, Famine before Plenty, Vice before Virtue? all which would be if idle time wery allow'd; for Idleness never found out Arts nor Sciences, or rules of Government, nor the ease of Temperance, nor the profit of Prudence, nor the commands of Fortitude, nor the peace of Justice, which Industry produceth; but Idleness brings Confusion.</p>

                     <p>I shall take my discourse at this time out of Beauty, the ground of which discourse is Eyes; Eyes are the Beauty of Beauty; for if the Eyes be not good, the face though ne'r so fair, or otherwise well featur'd, cannot be pleasing; the truth is, Eyes are the most Curious, Ingenious, Delightfull; and Profita|ble work in Nature; Curious in the Aspect and Splendor; Ingenious in the form and fashion, Delightfull in the Society, and Profitable in their Com|merce, Trade, and Traffick, that they have with all the rest of Natures works: for had not Nature made Eyes, all her works had been lost, as be|ing buryed in everlasting darkness; for it is not only Light that shews her works, but Eyes that see her works: wherefore if Nature had not made Eyes she had lost the glory of Admiration and Adoration, which all her Animal Creatures give her, begot, raised, or proceeding from what they see; besides, not only Light the presenter of objects would have been lost, but Life would have been but only a dull Melancholy Motion for want of sight, and for want of sight life would have wanted knowledge, and so would have been ignorant both of its self and Nature; but now life takes delight by the fight, through the Eyes, and is inamor'd with the Beauties it
<pb n="519" facs="271"/>
views; and the Eyes do not only delight themselves and life with what they receive, but with what they send forth; for Eyes are not only passages to let Light, Coulours, Forms, and Figures in, but to let Passions, Affections, Opini|ons out; besides, the Eyes are not only as Navigable Seas, for the Animal Spirits to Traffick on, and Ports to Anchor in; but they are the Gardens of the Soul, wherein the Soul sits and refreshes it self, and Love the Sun of the Soul, sends forth more glorious Rayes than that Sun in the Sky, and on those objects they do shine, they both comfort and give a nourishing delight; but yet when the light of love doth reflect, the heat doth increase by double lines, and quickness of motion, which causes many times a Distemper of the Thoughts, which turns to a Feavor in the Mind; but to conclude most Noble and Right Honourable, Eyes are the Starrs which appear only in the Animal Globe, to direct the life in its Voyage, not only to places that life knows, but to new discoveryes; and these Animal Starrs do not only guide the Animal life, but have an influence and various effects on the Soul, and are not only to view the Beauties of all the other works of Nature, but are the chiefest Beauties themselves; and if that Reason that is the Educator of the Life, and chief Ruler and Commander of the Soul, did not cross and hinder the influence of these Animal Starrs, they would prove very fatal to many a one: Wherefore Right Honourable, my Application is, that you obey Reason, and pray unto it as to a Deity, that it may divert the Malig|nant influences, and cause them to point to a Happy Effect.</p>
                     <l>For which my good wishes shall attend you,</l>

                     <p>Heaven forbid Wife you should become a Thorn in my Mind, but thou art there as my Soul, nor do I love you at a common rate: for were thy person more deformed than ever Nature made, either by Sickness or Casualty, I still should love thee for thy Virtuous Soul; and though your person is very handsom, yet I consider not your Beauty but your Health, so you be well, I care not how you look; for my love is at that height as it is beyond the body grown; for should I only love you for your Beauty, when that is decayed, my love must of necessity dy, if Beauty were the life.</p>

                     <p>To quarrel and fight for me is strange, for as for the one I never saw, and the other I have no acquaintance with; but had I favoured the one, or affronted the other, or had favoured them both, it might have raised a dispute, from a dispute to a quarrel, from a quarrel to a duell; but many times men make a seeming love the occasi|on to shew their courage, to get a fame; but what fame soever men get, the woman loses, as being thought either too kind, or cruell.</p>

                     <p>A Souldier? why he never lead an Army, nor pitcht a Field, nor fought a Battel; he never Intrencht, nor Incampt; he never guarded, kept, nor took Fort, Town, or City; perchance he hath studied as most Gentlemen do, so much of Fortification, as to talk of Trenches, Lines, Ramparts, Bullworks, Curtains, Wings, Faces, Forts, Centries; And of Amunition, Cannon, Muskets, Carabines, Pistols, Slings, Bowes, Arrows, Darts, Pikes, Bills, Halbards, Bolts, Poleaxes, Swords, Ci|meters, Shot, Bullets, Powder, Drums, Trumpets, Waggons, Tents and the like; and for Arms, Pot, Back, Breast, Gantlets, Corselers, Gorgets and the like, thus they learn the Names, but seldome practice the use.</p>

                     <p>The truth of it is, that my Landlady as old as she is, loves the Company of men, especially of young men; for if a young man will trou|ble himself to stay in her Company, and talk to her, she is so pleased, as she makes more wrinckles with her smiles, than Time hath made, and she will simperingly put in her Chin, as if she were but fifteen.</p>

                     <p>It is impossible that in so heavenly a form, a foolish Soul should be; for I perceive by your beautifull person, Nature hath out|wrought her self, having not Art or skill to make a Second, and what man would not be proud to serve the only she?</p>

                     <l>And for to speak the truth of marriage laws;</l>
                     <l>Or else through ignorance each man and wife,</l>

                        <hi>Noble and Right Honourable,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From the root of Self-love grows many several Branches; as Divine, Love, Moral Love, Natural and Sympathetical Love, Neighbourly and Ma|trimonial Love; Divine Love is the Love to the Gods, Moral Love is the
<pb n="525" facs="274"/>
Love to Virtue, Natural Love is the Love to Parents and Children, Sympa|thetical Love is of Lovers, or Friendships, Neighbourly Love is the Love of Acquaintance, and true Matrimonial Love is the Love of United Souls, and Bodyes; but I shall only insist or discourse at this time for my Sisters sakes, of Matrimonial Love; this Matrimonial Love, is the first imbodyed Love that Nature created; for as for Divine Love, and Moral Love, they are as incorporeal as the Soul, and Sympathetical and Matrimonial Love, which I will joyn as Soul and Body, were before Natural, or Neighbourly Love, for Marriage beget, Acquaintance, and none lives so neer nor converses so much as man and wife; and there was a Sympathy and Conjunction of each Sex, before there were Children, and there could be no Parents before there were Children; thus Matrimonial Love was the first substantial Love, and being the Original and producing Love, ought to be honoured and preferr'd as the most perfect and greatest Love in Nature; but mistake me not Noble and Right Honourable, when I say the greatest Love in Nature, I mean not the Supernatural Love, as Divine Love as to the Gods; but this Matrimonial Love, I say is to be the most respected, as the Original Love, like as Nature is to be honoured and preferred before the Creatures she makes; so Matri|monial Love ought to be respected first, as being the cause of Friendly, So|ciable, Neighbourly, and Fatherly Love; wherefore man and wife ought to forsake all the world, in respect of each other, and to prefer no other delight before each others good or content; for the Love of Parents and Children, or any other Love proceeding from Nature, ought to be waved when as they come in Competition with the Love man and wife; for though Matri|monial Love is not such a Divine Love as from man to the Gods, yet it is as the Love of Soul and Body, also it is as a Divine Society, as being a Union; but Right Honourable, to tell you, my opinion is, that I belive very few are truly married; for it is not altogether the Ceremony of the Church nor State that makes a true marriage; but a Union and indissoluble Conjunction of Souls and Bodyes of each Sex; wherefore all those that are allowed of as man and wife, by the Church, State, and Laws, yet they are but Adul|terers, unless their Souls, Bodyes, and Affections, are united as one; for its not the joyning of hands, speaking such words by Authentical persons, nor making of vows, and having Witnesses thereof, that makes a true marriage, no more than an Absolution without a Contrition, makes a holy man: wherefore dear Sisters, and you two Heroick Worthies, marry as you ought to do, or else live single lives, otherwise your Children will be of a Bastard kind, and your associating but as Beasts, which are worse than Birds, for they orderly chuse their Mates, and lovingly fly and live together, and equally labour to build their nest, to feed their young, and Sympathetically live, and love each other, which order and love few married persons ob|serve, nor practice; but after all this, even those marriages that are the per|fectest, purest, lovingest, and most equallest, and Sympathetically joyned, yet at the best marriage is but the womb of trouble, which cannot be avoided, also marriage is the grave or tomb of Wit; for which I am resolved for my part to live a single life, associating my self with my own Thoughts, marrying my self to my own Contemplations, which I hope to conceive and bring forth a Child of Fame, that may live to posterity, and to keep a-live my Memory; not that I condemn those that marry, for I do worship married persons, as accounting them Saints, as being Martyrs for the good cause of the Common-wealth, Sacrificing their own Happiness and Tranquillity,
<pb n="526" facs="275"/>
for the weal publick; for there is none that marries that doth not increase their Cares and Pains; but marriage Unites into Familyes, Familyes into Villages, Villages into Cities, Cities into Corporations, Corporations into Common-wealths; this increase keeps up the race of Mankind, and causes Commerce, Trade, and Traffick, all which associates men into an Agree|ment, and by an Agreement men are bound to Laws, by Laws they are bound to Punishments, by Punishments to Magistrates, and by Magistrates and Punishments to Obedience, by Obedience to Peace and Defence, in which Center of Peace my dear Sisters, I wish you may live, and be guarded with the Circumference of Defence, that nothing may disturb or indanger you or yours; and that you may live in true marriage,and increase with united love, blest with Virtuous Children, and inrich'd with prudent Care, and Industry: also I wish and pray that Jealousy may be banished from your Thoughts, Pains and Sickness from your Bodyes, Poverty from your Fami|lyes, evill Servants from your Imployments, Disobedience from your Children.</p>
                     <l>And that Death may not rob you of your breed,</l>

               <l>O How my heart doth ake when think I do,</l>
               <l>How I a modest Maid a man did woo!</l>
               <l>To be so confident to woo him here,</l>
               <l>Upon the publick Stage to every Ear;</l>
               <l>Men sure will censure me for mad, if not</l>
               <l>To be in some unlucky Planet got,</l>
               <l>Or else will tax me of dishonesty,</l>
               <l>As seeming like a bold immodesty;</l>
               <l>Well, I have woo'd, yet am I not despis'd,</l>
               <l>But am by Virtuous honour highly priz'd;</l>
               <l>Because my Love was spotless, pure, and Chast,</l>
               <l>And on a noble worthy man was plac'd;</l>
               <l>Then why should I blush, weep, or yet repent,</l>
               <l>Or shun the wooing part to represent,</l>
               <l>But rather joy and glory in my choice?</l>
